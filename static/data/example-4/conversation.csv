start,end,speaker,content
4,6,Teacher,"Okay. The bells are kind of messed up so we will- I will probably just go ahead and dismiss you. We're now starting like five minutes late,"
15,17,Teacher,because they didn't get the bells working right.
16,18,Teacher,"All right, who is absent? Anybody?"
19,21,New student,I don't know.
21,23,Teacher,You don't know? Do you know who sits at your table normally?
25,27,New student,//He's missing. Who is he?
26,28,New student,//I don't know who is supposed to-
27,29,New student,Devin is not here.
28,30,New student,No. He's //here.
29,31,Teacher,//Devin is gone.
30,32,Single student,He's here.
31,33,Teacher,Right. He's here.
35,37,Teacher,"Jennifer, I'm gonna have you move to-"
41,43,Teacher,"Yeah, a table of three people, not the one that's got four. "
46,48,Teacher,"All right, so nobody is absent? Everybody is here?"
49,51,New student,Yeah.
52,54,Teacher,Okay. 
57,59,Teacher,"Um, I'm not going to return your papers today. I'll save that for tomorrow. We'll get right into what we're going to be talking about today. "
66,68,Teacher,There's just a couple of things that I needed to go over with you first that I'm not sure that you got it before. 
76,78,Teacher,Yes? Writing your homework books? Okay. 
84,86,Teacher,All right. Open up your book. What? 
88,90,New student,I can't hear out of my ear.
90,92,Teacher,What's wrong?
91,93,Single student,It hurts.
93,95,Teacher,Did you ever go to the doctor?
95,97,Single student,Yeah.
96,98,New student,"Miss A, (inaudible)."
97,99,Teacher,What?
98,100,New student,(inaudible).
99,101,Teacher,Okay. Take these right here. Go. Bye. They must feel like they have the plague or something.
108,110,Teacher,All right. You ready?
110,112,New student,Yeah.
111,113,Teacher,Okay. On page- open your book to page 588. 
114,116,Teacher,There are- 
123,125,Teacher,There are some weather maps. There's actually four weather maps on those pages that are in front of you. 
128,130,Teacher,"They are showing a progression of weather over a four-day period? Three-day period, okay. Where the weather is going. "
139,141,Teacher,"Looking at those four maps, looking at the one on the page before that- flip one page back- "
151,153,Teacher,"Okay? And looking on the page after that- flip two pages, forward- "
160,162,Teacher,"So you're looking at page 587, 88, 89, and 90- find the high pressure centers; "
175,177,Teacher,"find the low pressure centers,"
180,182,Teacher,"on any one of those five or six maps,"
184,186,Teacher,find the cold fronts and the warm fronts. 
190,192,Teacher,"Okay, now here's a puzzle for you. What do you notice about fronts and pressure centers?"
198,200,Teacher,What do you notice about the fronts and the high pressure; and the fronts and the low pressure?
204,206,Teacher,Look- and you gotta look at the map in order to answer the question.
209,211,Teacher,"And if you can't figure it out with one map, move to another map."
215,217,Teacher,Make some comparisons.
218,220,Teacher,What pattern do you notice about fronts and pressure centers?
233,235,New student,I have a question.
234,236,Teacher,"Mm. No- no, no. I'm waiting."
238,240,New student,I have a question.
239,241,Teacher,Oh. Question? Okay.
240,242,Single student,Aren't the pointed ones the warm fronts?
243,245,Teacher,The pointed ones are the cold fronts.
245,247,Single student,Okay. I was just making sure.
250,252,Teacher,"I thought you were gonna answer the question. I am waiting for some people to get that look on their face, like, ""oh."" "
262,264,Teacher,"Stuart, are you noticing anything?"
268,270,Teacher,Is there something you're noticing about the high pressure centers that is not the same as the low pressure centers?
281,283,New student,Besides the- besides the points?
284,286,Teacher,Besides the what?
285,287,Single student,"The points, the triangle-"
286,288,Teacher,What about the points?
288,290,Single student,That there's like more(inaudible)-
291,293,Teacher,There's no triangles where?
293,295,Single student,No. There's more triangles-
294,296,Teacher,Oh.
295,297,Single student,Than there's (inaudible).
297,299,Teacher,Oh. Okay. So there's more cold fronts than warm fronts?
300,302,Single student,Yeah.
300,302,Teacher,"Okay, but what about the low pressure centers and what about the high pressure centers? "
315,317,Teacher,"Mitch, what do you think?"
316,318,New student,I think that there's low pressure centers on the cold fronts and the warm fronts too. Like on a front //there's like a-
323,325,Teacher,//And what about the high pressure centers?
325,327,Single student,They are moving away from the front.
328,330,Teacher,"They don't seem to have fronts attached to them, do they?"
332,334,Single student,No.
333,335,Teacher,"You notice that, Jeff?"
334,336,New student,Uh-huh.
335,337,Teacher,Look at all the low pressure centers. Do you see fronts attached to them? 
339,341,Teacher,"No. Can you tell me why? Remember the balloon thing? Can you tell me why? Jeff, what do you think?"
349,351,Single student,"Uh, when it hits the hot air, it would like go above it. Like-"
356,358,Teacher,So you got a warm air mass and a cold air mass?
358,360,Single student,"Yes. And when it hits- I remember, but- I remember it, but it's hard to explain."
365,367,Teacher,Okay. You're saying the warm air rises above that cold air?
369,371,Single student,Yes. 
370,372,Teacher,Okay. 
371,373,Single student,And the-
374,376,Teacher,And the warm air has what kind of pressure?
378,380,Single student,Low pressure.
379,381,Teacher,"Okay. Mark, did you have something to add?"
381,383,New student,No. I was gonna say (inaudible).
384,386,Teacher,"Okay. Let me show you a real easy way to really kind of understand it. I have three balloons this time, and they are different color. Red is?"
394,396,New student,Cold.
395,397,Two or more students,Warm.
396,398,Teacher,Warm air. Blue is?
397,399,Two or more students,Cold.
398,400,Teacher,"Cold, and yellow is?"
399,401,Two or more students,Warm.
400,402,Teacher,Is cooler. Let's say cooler. All right. Let's look up here for a second. 
407,409,Teacher,"And you'll even notice on this map there aren't any fronts attached to those low pressure centers, right? "
412,414,Teacher,"Just- or to the high pressure centers. Just to the low pressure centers, right? "
416,418,New student,Uh-huh.
417,419,Teacher,Okay. So where would the red balloon go? If this is the- what kind of front?
423,425,Two or more students,Cold.
424,426,New student,Cold front.
425,427,Teacher,Then where's the warm air going to be?
427,429,Two or more students,Going behind it.
428,430,Teacher,Behind it? This is the front of a warm air mass?
432,434,New student,"Uh, no. It's gonna be in front of it."
433,435,Teacher,It's gonna be in front of it?
434,436,New student,Yeah.
435,437,Teacher,Okay. Where's the cold air gonna be?
437,439,Entire class,Behind it.
438,440,Teacher,"Behind it. And we'll put the yellow air up here, okay? This is where the low pressure center happens. Watch what happens. "
445,447,Teacher,Here's the warm air. Here's the cold air. Here's the cool air. You see the hole in between the three?
451,453,Entire class,Yeah.
452,454,Teacher,"There's your low pressure center. It's where those big bubbles of air have a depression, or an area, a gap, that space, "
462,464,Teacher,that's the low. See? Yeah.
465,467,Two or more students,Yeah. 
466,468,Teacher,"Ah. Okay? That's what you're looking at. You're looking at that bubble of warm air, the bubble of cold air behind. "
473,475,Teacher,"Here's the front right here, right? The front of the air mass, yes? "
477,479,Teacher,"And then where they all meet up- where these bubbles of air meet up, that's where that low pressure center comes in. "
484,486,Teacher,The high pressure is going to be this big bubble of cold air at the very highest point of it as far as pressure goes. 
494,496,Teacher,"It's not gonna ever have a front because it occurs in like the middle of the air mass, okay? "
500,502,New student,Okay.
501,503,Teacher,Get it?
502,504,New student,Yeah.
503,505,Teacher,Ooh. Yes?
504,506,New student,So then basically a tornado would be caused because of low pressure in the (inaudible)?
510,512,Teacher,"Yes. That depression of low pressure air, right. What you got is air funneling in and air funneling up at the same time, "
519,521,Teacher,"and then once it starts to twist- when we see that video on ""Understanding Weather,"" "
523,525,Teacher,it's really cool because it shows the air funneling like this on the ground. What's that called?
531,533,New student,Conven- 
532,534,New student,Convection current.
533,535,Teacher,"Right. It shows that on the ground like a big tube doing that, and then when that- I think it showed cold air- hits it- excuse me- hits it, "
543,545,Teacher,it- remember when I said the cold air hits that blue and the blue goes flying off- or the-
548,550,New student,Uh-huh.
549,551,Teacher,Cold air hits the red and the warm air goes flying up? That's what causes the storm? 
553,555,Teacher,"What it shows is that that tube gets split and splits up this way, and that's the beginning of a funnel cloud. It's very cool. "
562,564,Teacher,"But you'll see that on the, uh, video. Okay. So does that help with low pressure and high pressure and-"
568,570,New student,Yeah.
569,571,New student,//Yeah.
570,572,Teacher,//Okay? Kind of a visual.
571,573,New student,Uh-huh.
572,574,Teacher,Okay. The reason you need to know that is because this is what you are going to be doing. 
576,578,Teacher,First hour did not even finish the cities on their map which was kind of disappointing. I thought they'd get further than that. 
584,586,Teacher,"You do not need- and I won't let you use- your book or your notes. I was going to let you, and then I thought, "
592,594,Teacher,"No, I think that you need to get that station model plugged into your head a little better than you have it. "
598,600,Teacher,"Okay? So you don't need any of that. You may use the map on page 770, I think. Check page 770 in your book. "
613,615,Teacher,"There should be, yep, a map of the United States. You also have a map like this at your table with all of the cities on it. "
621,623,Teacher,Oh. They don't have one down there. 
623,625,Teacher,"Hannah, would- would you take that map down to the office and ask them to give it to the kids inside the conference room?"
632,634,New student,Okay.
633,635,Teacher,"Okay? I think they brought the map back from their- and then tell them to leave it there. Leave the pencils and the map, okay?"
640,642,Teacher,"All right, so you've got enough reference for finding certain cities. You're going to get a list of 12 cities in the United States."
648,650,Teacher,"Oh, that stays on; this goes off."
649,651,Teacher,"A list of 12 cities in the United States, with some other data. I told you this last week."
656,658,Teacher,And you're going to get a blank map that- handing out?
662,664,New student,(inaudible)
663,665,Teacher,Okay. Handing out?
666,668,New student,Here. (inaudible)
667,669,Teacher,Yeah. Dorothy.
668,670,Teacher,"I want to let Dorothy do it, because she threw her hand out there first. I didn't think she wanted to get up, but she does."
674,676,Teacher,"Okay. You're gonna get a sheet like this, that has all of the instructions that you need on it."
679,681,Teacher,"What you are going to do is, on the map, in front of you- and put all your notes away right now-"
685,687,Teacher,"any notes, any... You can only have your book open at page 770."
705,707,Teacher,"Okay. On the blue sheet is a list of the 12 cities, around the country. You might wanna make note that-"
715,717,Teacher,"Hatteras, fourth from the bottom, is actually called ""Cape Hatteras""; "
722,724,Teacher,"most of you have probably never heard of it. You will, though, by the time we get done with oceans."
727,729,Teacher,It is in North Carolina. North Carolina.
733,735,Teacher,I'm not gonna show you where that is; you ought to know where North Carolina is.
737,739,Teacher,"And, uh, Kansas City. There are two big Kansas Cities. We're talking about- thank you- Kansas City, Missouri. Okay?"
746,748,Teacher,"So you might wanna write ""MO"" after Kansas City, just so you remember where it's from."
759,761,Teacher,"All right, who wants to read the directions? I'm gonna stop you a lot as you go through, and explain certain things."
764,766,Teacher,"Mark, go ahead."
765,767,New student,Locate and label each of the above cities on the attachment.
769,771,Teacher,"Okay. The first thing you're going to do is find the cities, one at the time. Detroit, okay?"
775,777,Teacher,"When you find it on the map, you're gonna put the little dot where Detroit goes."
782,784,Teacher,"Then you're gonna write ""Detroit,"" but you've got to write small, and you've got to write neat, so that I can read it. "
789,791,Teacher,"Stuart, you haven't started yet, have you?"
790,792,New student,No.
791,793,Teacher,"Don't, because I- I've got to tell you the whole thing. "
795,797,Teacher,"Remember where Detroit goes on a station- a weather station model, right? "
802,804,Teacher,"Many of you forgot to put ""Weather City"" when you had to redo another station model on that worksheet. "
808,810,Teacher,Lots of people did not put that city name. They put all the other stuff but didn't put the city. 
813,815,Teacher,"So when you write ""Detroit,"" to the left of it make your circle right away and start building that station model."
823,825,Teacher,"Otherwise, if you go through and write all the cities first, then you're gonna have to go back and make sure you've got room to put the station model. "
831,833,Teacher,"So do one city at a time, okay? Do you know what I'm saying? "
834,836,New student,Uh-huh.
835,837,Teacher,You got it? Yes?
836,838,New student,(inaudible)?
837,839,Teacher,Like this. I'll just start this first one just so you know. 
840,842,Teacher,"If you have got this part of Michigan right here, and you put the dot, you need to write ""Detroit"" over here, okay? "
851,853,Teacher,And then start your station model right here.
855,857,Teacher,All right? A reminder that the wind direction is that arrow to the middle.
862,864,Teacher,All right? And- I'm trying to think what else they had trouble with. They had a little trouble last hour with cloud coverage in the circle. 
872,874,Teacher,"If you're not sure, ask someone at your table first before I come around to help you with that. Make sure you get it before- "
878,880,Teacher,"or somebody else- you've asked somebody else before you ask me, okay? "
883,885,Teacher,"Because you had the 25%, you had the 50%, and you had the 75% then you had full coverage. "
888,890,Teacher,"Remember what those meant because that's how they are on this sheet, okay? Okay. So there's your- any questions on the station model? "
899,901,Teacher,"You know where everything goes on there? There are only two cities with current conditions, and I'll put the symbols on the board. "
904,906,Teacher,"They're very simple, okay? So you don't need that chart either. Okay. Next one. Mark, keep going."
912,914,New student,Construct a weather station map for each of the above cities. Place them at approximate locations.
918,920,Teacher,Appropriate locations. 
920,922,Single student,//Oh.
921,923,Teacher,"//Yep. All right. Now, that's as far as everybody got for second hour, okay? Go ahead and read on, Mark."
928,930,Single student,Place high and low pressure centers where you think that- where you think they would be located on the map. 
934,936,Teacher,You're gonna have to look at what in order to do that? What's some indicators of high and low pressure? 
942,944,Teacher,"Oh, no. You know what we thought of last hour? Don't do this one. Put an arrow, four, five, and five to four. "
949,951,Teacher,"Do step five first. It'll make four a lot easier. Or three and four. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Wait, wait, wait. "
956,958,Teacher,"Do step four first and then go back up and do step three. Read step four, Mark, so I can explain what I mean there."
966,968,Single student,Shade regions of precipitation. Place symbol for cold and warm fronts where they would most- most likely be located on the map.
976,978,Teacher,Okay. Do you see why I said to do this one first?
979,981,New student,Uh-huh.
980,982,Teacher,"When you find the areas of precipitation and then you find the cold and warm fronts, "
985,987,Teacher,"it should be a lot easier to put the low pressure and high pressure centers, right? Okay. "
990,992,Teacher,So do number four first and then go back and do number three. When you shade for precipitation: 
999,1001,Teacher,"if it's light rain, it's a light green; if it's medium rain, if they just say rain, then it's a yellow; and if it's a thunderstorm, then it's red. "
1009,1011,Teacher,"That's how the Doppler Radar satellite picture picks it up, okay? It's the density of the air is what they pick up, all right?"
1017,1019,Teacher,"Okay. Go ahead, Mark."
1019,1021,New student,Answer the following questions. Interpret the data using your (map weather). 
1025,1027,Single student,Explain the locations of high and low pressure centers in warm and cool fronts. 
1031,1033,Single student,Are there any environmental or severe weather incidents that may occur? Include the weather indications in the map. 
1040,1042,Single student,Use your weather map to explain the above answer.
1044,1046,Teacher,Okay. This will be on a separate sheet of paper- probably won't get it until about the middle of class tomorrow-
1050,1052,Teacher,"where now you have to explain why you put everything on your map where you put it, okay? "
1056,1058,Teacher,"So you're kind of explaining yourself: low pressure, high pressure. And hopefully you'll be able to do that. "
1062,1064,Teacher,"I think you can, if you allow yourself to think in that direction. Okay, and then six."
1070,1072,Single student,"Using the data on the weather, forecast the weather for October 24th, 2002, for each of the cities of the (inaudible)-"
1078,1080,Teacher,Okay. Are there any questions about what I expect you to do? No? 
1086,1088,Teacher,So I will be able to just sit here the whole time you're doing this and just watch you like last hour? Todd?
1095,1097,New student,"I don't get shade regions of precipitation."""
1099,1101,Teacher,"Okay. On the map that you had to do for the weather station models, they told you to shade the areas of precipitation. "
1106,1108,Teacher,The same way that this map did- you see how they shaded these areas? Where it's raining. 
1114,1116,Teacher,"And once you get done with all your station models, you'll be able to see it better. "
1117,1119,Teacher,"You'll look for the cloudy areas, and then from that you'll look for the rainy areas."
1120,1122,Single student,"Now I know, I just- I thought you meant to do four completely first."
1126,1128,Teacher,"No. No. Well, yeah. You're gonna do four first before you do three."
1130,1132,Single student,"I know that, but I thought-"
1131,1133,Teacher,"Oh, no. Not before two though, right. Okay. Got ya."
1134,1136,Teacher,Jeff?
1135,1137,New student,Do you work as a group or-
1136,1138,Teacher,"You work as a group, yes."
1137,1139,Single student,Okay.
1138,1140,Teacher,"Which means talking quietly about the mapping activity, not about what you did over the weekend, okay?"
1147,1149,Teacher,"Yes, Wes?"
1148,1150,New student,"I'm really not sure about these, uh, models we have to put down."
1153,1155,Teacher,Okay.
1154,1156,Single student,I don't quite understand them.
1155,1157,Teacher,Did you do that worksheet last week?
1157,1159,Single student,Which one?
1158,1160,Teacher,The one that you were supposed to turn in for a grade on Friday. 
1161,1163,Single student,I'm not sure.
1162,1164,Teacher,"You had ""weather city"" and then ""around the circle"" which had cloudiness in it."
1170,1172,Single student,I don't remember anything like that. I remember most of last week.
1174,1176,Teacher,"All right, I'm not sure you turned it in. "
1176,1178,Single student,I'm not sure either.
1177,1179,Teacher,Okay. We'll see what your group can help you with.
1181,1183,Single student,Okay.
1183,1185,Teacher,Jeff?
1184,1186,New student,I was wondering if I could move right next to Geoffrey so we-
1187,1189,Teacher,Sure. Mark?
1189,1191,New student,"When we're like doing Detroit, you said- do you want us to write- "
1192,1194,Single student,"like go through and write all the cities and then go and do the weather stations, or do the city and then the weather station?"
1198,1200,Teacher,Somebody want to answer Mark's question?
1201,1203,New student,Do the weather- the city and the weather station together.
1203,1205,New student,Okay.
1205,1207,Teacher,"Don't go- don't do all the cities first and then go back and do the stations because you might write the name of the city in the wrong place,"
1212,1214,Teacher,and you won't be able to fit the weather station around it. Hannah?
1215,1217,New student,"Okay. What do we do for, like, the current conditions?"
1221,1223,Teacher,Okay. There are only two. Thanks for that. There are only two. Let me pull this up. 
1228,1230,Teacher,"They call it on those dir- and that's actual data information from last Wednesday, the 23rd, straight off the Weather Channel. "
1237,1239,Teacher,"When you're all done, I'm going to give you the actual satellite map with the warm fronts and cold fronts and high and low pressures. "
1244,1246,Teacher,You're gonna compare that to what you came up with on your map. I'm looking at probably Wednesday by the time we get to that. 
1253,1255,Teacher,Then you're- you're gonna forecast at the bottom. Your last step is gonna be a forecast. 
1257,1259,Teacher,"Then you're gonna look at what happened the next day and see how well your forecast came out, okay? "
1262,1264,Teacher,"Uh, but on the Weather Channel, instead of calling it intermittent rain, they call it light rain. So this is the symbol for light rain. "
1271,1273,Teacher,"I know it's tough, and I don't know if you're gonna be able to remember it, but that's light rain, okay? "
1278,1280,Teacher,"There are no thunderstorms, none of that, all the fancy stuff they had on that chart. And guess what this is?"
1284,1286,Two or more students,Snow.
1285,1287,Teacher,Light snow. 
1287,1289,Teacher,"If it were heavy snow, there would be two of them. Oops. Okay? "
1295,1297,Teacher,"Any other questions? Yes, Wes?"
1299,1301,New student,"So if it was heavy rain, there would be two //little footnotes?"
1302,1304,Teacher,"//Two dots, yep. Yep."
1305,1307,New student,Can I have a pencil? I only brought a pen.
1308,1310,Teacher,"Yeah. If you need a pencil, let me know. Don't try to do this in pen. It's too- too much erasing going on. "
1314,1316,Teacher,"Yes, Mitch? Question?"
1317,1319,New student,"When we shade these, what colors did they- do you want us to have them?"
1321,1323,Teacher,I have a box of pencils right up- colored pencils. I did. Right up here. Whatever color you want except red or blue. 
1329,1331,Teacher,Oops. You needed this. 
1332,1334,Teacher,"Whatever color you want except red or blue, okay? All right. If there are no more questions, get started. "
1341,1343,Teacher,I'm gonna put this away so I don't trip on it. 
1349,1351,Teacher,Yes?
1350,1352,New student,I need a pencil.
1351,1353,Teacher,"Okay. Go back over there and get one from where I got it, top- that little top drawer. Mark, did you have a question?"
1357,1359,New student,I don't like sitting next to a wall.
1359,1361,New student,(inaudible)
1360,1362,Teacher,Why?
1361,1363,New student,(inaudible)
1364,1366,Teacher,On the wall? Do you want me to move you up here? 
1368,1370,Single student,"No, that's all right."
1369,1371,Teacher,Oh. I thought so. Christina?
1371,1373,New student,Can I sharpen my pencil?
1372,1374,Teacher,"Yes, you may sharpen your pencil."
1374,1376,New student,"Can I sharpen my pencil, too?"
1376,1378,Teacher,Yeah. You guys are supposed to do this beforehand. 
1386,1388,Teacher,"Okay. Let's see if I can talk you through this. You wrote ""the city of Detroit."" "
1391,1393,Teacher,"And then there was a circle next to it so just draw a circle, a relatively large circle. "
1400,1402,Teacher,Okay. Now- no. Don't fill it in. Just a //circle.
1401,1403,New student,//Oh.
1403,1405,Teacher,"And I just said ""use a pencil."" Is that a pencil?"
1405,1407,Single student,Yes.
1406,1408,Teacher,"Oh. That's a cool pencil. Okay. An open circle. Now, in the circle you have four choices. "
1417,1419,Teacher,"These are your choices: mostly sunny- no. Clear, mostly sunny, partly cloudy, mostly cloudy, cloudy. That's it. Five of them. Okay? "
1429,1431,Single student,"That would be cloudy, wouldn't it?"
1430,1432,Teacher,And they are- it's saying cloudy. And they are represented by how much you shade that circle. 
1437,1439,Single student,So that would be about 50% probably?
1438,1440,Teacher,"Actually, cloudy is gonna be all shaded. "
1441,1443,Single student,Okay.
1442,1444,Teacher,Okay? 
1444,1446,Teacher,"And let me see your pencil for a minute, and I'll draw them on the back so you can- all right. "
1449,1451,Teacher,This one is totally unshaded so that's going to be what?
1454,1456,Single student,"Uh, sunny. "
1455,1457,Teacher,Clear. Yeah. Sunny or clear. This one is gonna be a quarter shaded. 
1460,1462,Teacher,This one is gonna be- let's do them all first and then you can compare. This one is gonna be this way. 
1469,1471,Teacher,And that one is gonna be completely- and you know this one's cloudy and this one's clear. 
1473,1475,Teacher,"Okay? So now your other options are mostly cloudy, mostly sunny or partly cloudy."
1481,1483,Single student,"Okay. So that would be sunny, partly- that would be sunny, that would be partly cloudy, mostly cloudy, right? No. No."
1493,1495,Teacher,Okay. If-
1494,1496,Single student,"//Oh, boy."
1495,1497,Teacher,"//That's all right. Relax. If that's clear, then this is like mostly clear or mostly?"
1501,1503,Single student,Mostly clear.
1503,1505,Teacher,Mostly clear or mostly? If this one's sunny- 
1508,1510,Single student,Mostly sunny.
1509,1511,Teacher,Okay. This one is mostly sunny. Now you've got mostly cloudy and partly cloudy and these two left. 
1517,1519,Teacher,Which one's mostly cloudy and which one's partly cloudy? What's that one?
1522,1524,Single student,Mostly cloudy.
1523,1525,Teacher,What's that one?
1524,1526,Single student,Partly cloudy.
1525,1527,Teacher,Okay. So you've got-
1527,1529,Single student,"Sunny, clear."
1529,1531,Teacher,Yeah. Sunny or clear.
1530,1532,Single student,"Mostly sunny, partly cloudy, mostly cloudy, cloudy."
1536,1538,Teacher,Beautiful.
1537,1539,Teacher,"Detroit was easy, but you're gonna get to some other ones that- okay? "
1542,1544,Teacher,"All right, now, the next thing that you have to figure out is where the temperature goes and where the dew point goes. "
1547,1549,Teacher,"You guys, you have humidity information. Does it go on the weather station model anywhere?"
1553,1555,New student,No.
1555,1557,Two or more students,No.
1556,1558,Teacher,"No. We didn't put humidity on there, did we?"
1558,1560,Single student,So I don't need-
1559,1561,New student,(inaudible)
1560,1562,Teacher,"Well, just- you don't need it right now. You'll need it to answer some questions, but you don't need it on the weather station model. Mark?"
1566,1568,New student,For Detroit how is eight mile an hour- (you got us around 10).
1569,1571,Teacher,"Eight-mile-an-hour wind- I told you last week, your choice. It's either a five- you listening, Geoffrey? "
1577,1579,Teacher,Eight-mile-an-hour wind is either a five or a 10. Your choice. 
1581,1583,Teacher,"If you show me three long lines there, I'm gonna know you didn't know what you were doing, okay? All right. "
1588,1590,Teacher,Do you remember where temperature went? 
1595,1597,New student,Right above it. 
1596,1598,Teacher,Yeah. Right above it to the left. 
1604,1606,Teacher,Okay. And then dew point went? 
1607,1609,Single student,Upper right a bit?
1609,1611,Teacher,Below left. 
1616,1618,Teacher,Okay? You've got the city there. Do you remember what goes above the city on this thing?
1623,1625,Single student,The pressure?
1624,1626,Teacher,Yep. 
1625,1627,New student,Then we do- write on the left.
1629,1631,New student,Pressure is on the left.
1634,1636,Teacher,"When you do the pressure, make sure you show falling, steady or rising, either with the letters or the arrows. "
1640,1642,Teacher,"Rising would be just shooting straight across, a horizontal line. "
1647,1649,Teacher,"Okay. So, now, if you're not doing humidity, the only thing you have left is wind speed and direction. Do you remember how that was represented? "
1654,1656,Single student,"Um, (by an arrow)."
1656,1658,Teacher,Huh?
1657,1659,Single student,By an arrow.
1658,1660,Teacher,An arrow that's shooting into the circle.
1660,1662,Single student,Right.
1661,1663,Teacher,"And it is a //northeast wind, so- "
1662,1664,Single student,//North... in this area down here? That way? 
1665,1667,Teacher,That's northwest.
1666,1668,New student,"You're thinking of, like, Las Vegas and Nevada."
1667,1669,Teacher,Yeah.
1670,1672,Teacher,"If you have trouble remembering your directions, make little compass rows at the top of your map. "
1676,1678,New student,Ah. 
1677,1679,Teacher,Ah. 
1685,1687,New student,Let's see if I find the state.
1687,1689,New student,(Do we do that) (inaudible)?
1689,1691,Teacher,No. You don't need to worry- all of these weather- or all of the wind directions are in either northeast or south- or south- 
1695,1697,Teacher,"I didn't put east, northeast or-"
1697,1699,New student,Okay.
1698,1700,Teacher,No. I didn't do any of that.
1699,1701,Single student,Okay.
1700,1702,New student,Where is Hatteras?
1701,1703,New student,"Can I see the map when you're done, Hannah?"
1704,1706,New student,What state is it in?
1707,1709,Teacher,"You can tell her, Jennifer."
1709,1711,New student,I don't know.
1710,1712,Teacher,"Oh, you guys, I told you where it was."
1712,1714,New student,I- I remember it.
1713,1715,New student,"I found out, this-"
1714,1716,New student,"If you remember, then you can tell me."
1717,1719,New student,I remember her telling us. I just don't remember where.
1719,1721,New student,I remember her talking about it.
1721,1723,New student,This is a-
1724,1726,New student,Cape Hatteras-
1726,1728,Teacher,"Yes. In your- on your map in your book it says Cape Hatteras, right. "
1730,1732,New student,Okay. It's in the book. 
1731,1733,New student,"Oh, that helps."
1732,1734,New student,"Oh, that hurt. "
1733,1735,Teacher,It's not on your plastic map. 
1734,1736,Single student,Oh. It's not?
1735,1737,Teacher,Does that help? 
1736,1738,Single student,No.
1737,1739,Teacher,I don't think it is. It might be.
1738,1740,New student,It's North Carolina.
1741,1743,Teacher,Nope. It's not on your plastic map.
1743,1745,New student,It's out in the ocean.
1745,1747,Teacher,"Well, no. The name is out in the ocean. The little dot //is actually on land."
1747,1749,New student,//There's no dot.
1748,1750,New student,There's no dot.
1749,1751,New student,It's just out in the middle of the ocean.
1756,1758,Teacher,You're right. There is no dot. Hmm. I'm looking in the wrong place anyways. //I'm looking in-
1761,1763,New student,//(Where's) New York in New York? It's not on this map. It must be on that-
1763,1765,New student,"It's on the very corner, like, //if you (go) that way, let's say go to B, it's on the very bottom."
1765,1767,Teacher,//New York is on here. It's just very hard to find.
1767,1769,New student,All right. On this one?
1768,1770,Teacher,Mm-hm. Here's the state.
1770,1772,Single student,Right. //Oh. There it is.
1771,1773,Teacher,Here's the city right there. Yeah.
1772,1774,Single student,I'm stupid.
1774,1776,Teacher,You're not stupid. It's just buried on an island.
1778,1780,New student,"You know, partly would be like-"
1779,1781,New student,Partly is 50. Partly is 50. 50. 
1782,1784,Single student,"Partly is 50. Partly is 50, Mitch."
1785,1787,New student,Okay.
1786,1788,New student,Mostly is 75 (inaudible) very cloudy.
1788,1790,Teacher,You haven't finished the Detroit station weather model yet.
1792,1794,Teacher,Shouldn't you finish that? Before you start one?
1794,1796,Teacher,"I mean, that's what I would do. I guess you can do it any way you want, but- I guess everybody else is doing it that way, too."
1804,1806,Teacher,"Remember to keep your handwriting very small and really nice and neat, those of you that struggle with neat. Really nice and neat."
1815,1817,New student,That good?
1817,1819,New student,There's a river. 
1818,1820,Teacher,Yes.
1819,1821,New student,"Miss A, there's a river through it, but there is no little dot for it."
1826,1828,Teacher,"How about on the plastic map? That's why I gave you that plastic map, too, because-"
1830,1832,New student,Plastic map. 
1832,1834,Teacher,"some of these cities- some of these cities are not as maj- well, Des Moines is a major city, but some aren't."
1840,1842,Single student,Oh. It's right in the middle of it.
1843,1845,Teacher,And they're just on weather maps because they have a weather station there.
1852,1854,New student,"Do we have to label like temperature, pressure?"
1855,1857,Teacher,What did you have to do on the weather station model?
1857,1859,Single student,I don't know. I-
1859,1861,Teacher,Oh. You mean tell me what it is? No. I know what it is.
1861,1863,Single student,All right.
1862,1864,Teacher,Yeah. No. You just write it down.
1865,1867,New student,"Okay, Jeff. Circle, and you put New York right there. Okay. And keep this- that right there."
1875,1877,New student,Can we just put like NC- I mean NY for like New York?
1880,1882,Teacher,Yeah. Make sure I'm not- make sure you don't get too much clutter around it so that you can't tell that that's what it is.
1885,1887,Single student,Okay.
1886,1888,Teacher,"Okay? So make it clear enough that I'll be able to see it, because NY could easily get lost in there."
1891,1893,Single student,Okay.
1892,1894,Teacher,Okay?
1895,1897,New student,"What do we put for ""steady?"""
1897,1899,Teacher,S.
1898,1900,Single student,S.
1899,1901,Teacher,"Or an arrow- here's your circle, "
1900,1902,New student,Yeah.
1901,1903,Teacher,An arrow just shooting off.
1902,1904,Single student,Okay. 
1921,1923,Single student,"Here you are, Mitch. "
1922,1924,New student,You can use the eraser.
1924,1926,New student,Use yours. My pencil doesn't show up.
1927,1929,New student,I'll go sharpen it. 
1929,1931,New student,No. We're supposed to pencil that.
1934,1936,Teacher,"You guys seem to be having a lot less trouble than second hour did, or maybe I just explained it better this time. I don't know."
1943,1945,New student,Miss A?
1944,1946,Teacher,Mm-hm.
1945,1947,Single student,It's hard for me to write //this small.
1946,1948,New student,//Now what are we supposed to do?
1947,1949,Teacher,I know. 
1948,1950,New student,It's hard for me to even write.
1949,1951,Teacher,I told you it would be a challenge for some of you. Yes. You have very large handwriting. 
1953,1955,New student,I got very horrible handwriting.
1954,1956,New student,(inaudible)
1955,1957,Teacher,"Oh, no. That looks good, though. That looks- that's pretty good for you. Yeah. "
1961,1963,Teacher,'Cause I know you would want to fill the map up with- like Los Angeles would cover from L.A. all the way to Florida. 
1966,1968,New student,I know. It probably would.
1967,1969,Teacher,"Mm-hm. Oh. Kansas City is Kansas City, Missouri. Did I say that? "
1973,1975,New student,Yeah.
1974,1976,Teacher,Okay. Missouri.
1976,1978,New student,Okay. I've seen (it in there).
1978,1980,New student,(inaudible)
1980,1982,Teacher,Hmm? Which one?
1983,1985,Single student,"Like Kansas City. I didn't know if it- it's right there, isn't it?"
1987,1989,Teacher,"Yep. It's right on the edge. And then there's another one in Kansas, too, but it's not as big of a city. This is a big city here."
1994,1996,New student,You can't even see it.
1995,1997,Teacher,I know. They don't have it on that map. Do they have it on the plastic one?
1999,2001,New student,Yeah.
2003,2005,Teacher,"Missouri. Yep. And Missouri, yep. And Kansas."
2010,2012,New student,"Miss A, what is it? North, south-"
2014,2016,New student,East and west.
2016,2018,New student,E- does east go right there?
2017,2019,Teacher,Mm-hm.
2018,2020,New student,I (don't) need painkillers.
2020,2022,Teacher,I can't give you medicine.
2022,2024,Single student,(inaudible)
2023,2025,Teacher,She would have to bring either a written- she would have to bring a note. We need something written that says that we can- 
2031,2033,Teacher,Do you want to go call home?
2034,2036,Single student,"Well, I don't want to go home."
2037,2039,Teacher,"Well, if you don't want to go home, can you call home and somebody can bring you the medicine?"
2040,2042,Single student,I don't have medicine.
2043,2045,Teacher,Aspirin? Painkiller?
2045,2047,Single student,"Aspirin? Will it, like, let me be able to hear?"
2048,2050,Teacher,"Tylenol? It won't let you hear, but it'll kill the hurt- it'll kill the pain if you're in pain."
2053,2055,Single student,I'm in a lot of pain.
2054,2056,Teacher,"Well, then you need to take like Tylenol or something. Do you want to call home? "
2059,2061,Single student,Yeah. 
2060,2062,Teacher,Okay. Do you want to call from here or do you want to go down to the office?
2061,2063,Single student,Doesn't matter.
2062,2064,Teacher,Is it like around here?
2064,2066,Single student,It's over there. It's not long distance.
2066,2068,Teacher,Okay. Yeah. Go ahead and call home. See if somebody can bring you something. We're not allowed to administer any medication. 
2072,2074,Teacher,Not even cough drops. Nine.
2074,2076,Single student,Press nine?
2075,2077,Teacher,Uh-huh.
2077,2079,New student,"Brooke, where did you get ""Des Moines""?"
2079,2081,Teacher,//Des Moines.
2080,2082,New student,//Des Moines. Des Moines.
2081,2083,Teacher,The S is silent.
2082,2084,Single student,It is in Iowa.
2084,2086,Teacher,In your book or the plastic map?
2086,2088,Single student,Plastic map.
2087,2089,Teacher,Plastic map only.
2088,2090,New student,Oh. 
2090,2092,Teacher,How far did you get? 
2091,2093,New student,I don't know where humidity goes.
2093,2095,Teacher,Where what?
2094,2096,Single student,Humidity goes. 
2095,2097,Teacher,Humidity. Were you listening when I gave directions?
2097,2099,Single student,(inaudible)
2100,2102,Teacher,You weren't listening? It's showing right now. What did I say about humidity? Did you have to put humidity on it last week?
2108,2110,Single student,Yeah.
2109,2111,Teacher,Think for a minute. Did you remember putting any on that worksheet we did?
2116,2118,Single student,Yeah.
2117,2119,New student,Isn't it-
2118,2120,Teacher,Humidity?
2119,2121,New student,"Yeah. It goes right below temperature, doesn't it?"
2121,2123,Teacher,Nnn-
2122,2124,Single student,No? It goes-
2123,2125,New student,Does it go below air pressure?
2125,2127,Teacher,Dew point goes below air temperature. Humidity is not on your station model at all. Remember I said that?
2132,2134,New student,Yeah. I got dew point underneath.
2135,2137,Teacher,Ah. It's not on there at all. 
2137,2139,Single student,Oh. Just pressure- what?
2139,2141,Teacher,Humidity isn't on there at all. 
2142,2144,Teacher,"There's no humidity on that station model. Because when you look at dew point, you should be able to tell what the humidity is like, right? "
2150,2152,Teacher,"For instance, look at-"
2155,2157,Teacher,is it New Orleans or Kansas City? Whose got a hundred percent humidity?
2162,2164,New student,Denver.
2163,2165,Teacher,Denver?
2164,2166,New student,Not only Denver.
2165,2167,Teacher,Okay. There's Denver. Okay. What's temperature in Denver?
2169,2171,Single student,30-30.
2170,2172,Teacher,What's dew point?
2171,2173,Single student,thirty
2172,2174,Teacher,So what does that tell you about the humidity?
2174,2176,Single student,It's gonna rain.
2175,2177,Teacher,What's the humidity?
2179,2181,Single student,Hundred.
2180,2182,Teacher,A hundred percent.
2182,2184,Single student,It's gonna rain or snow.
2183,2185,Teacher,"It's- and it is doing that, right? Right."
2187,2189,Single student,Or it's gonna- I don't know.
2196,2198,Teacher,"I will eliminate the ability to talk to your neighbors with- for the worksheet, if we're gonna talk about other things. "
2204,2206,New student,"Is your phone- it says- like I don't know if it //says ""message for you."""
2207,2209,Teacher,//Message for you. I know. Somebody called me last week and left me a message. I never answered it. 
2214,2216,Teacher,"Okay? Do you get it now, Stuart? No humidity because you can tell the humidity by the dew point. How are you doing?"
2221,2223,New student,Okay.
2222,2224,Teacher,"Now, these all have to go a certain way."
2225,2227,Single student,Right.
2226,2228,Teacher,This one I can't tell- oh. Okay. There it is. Your direction for wind.
2231,2233,Single student,Oh.
2240,2242,New student,What are the cloudies again? I forgot.
2243,2245,Teacher,The cloudies?
2244,2246,Single student,"Yes. Now, I know this is clear."
2247,2249,Teacher,Okay. 
2248,2250,Single student,And I say-
2250,2252,Teacher,What one is this one? 
2251,2253,Single student,I say cloudy.
2254,2256,Teacher,Okay. But you've got some sun there. Is it completely cloudy?
2259,2261,Single student,"No. It's just cloudy. Mostly cloudy is completely cloudy, right? The same thing?"
2266,2268,Teacher,Mostly cloudy means there must be some- a little bit of sun.
2270,2272,Single student,All right.
2271,2273,Teacher,So what have you got there? 
2272,2274,Single student,Mostly cloudy.
2273,2275,Teacher,A little bit of sun. Right. You want it all the way cloudy so what are you going to do?
2276,2278,Single student,Fill it in?
2277,2279,Teacher,Right.
2279,2281,Single student,"All right. So whole circle, that's cloudy."
2284,2286,Teacher,Uh-huh.
2285,2287,Single student,"And then half is partly cloudy, right?"
2289,2291,Teacher,Yes. 
2294,2296,Single student,"And then... cloudy, partly cloudy, and then mostly cloudy is 75%. "
2303,2305,Teacher,Yep. 
2309,2311,Teacher,That's right. You know what it is. You're the only one that has to look at it. So then what is going to be mostly sunny?
2321,2323,Single student,This?
2322,2324,New student,A quarter. 
2323,2325,Teacher,That's clear. That's completely sunny.
2327,2329,New student,Completely sunny?
2328,2330,Teacher,"If you've got partly cloudy here, what's mostly sunny gonna look like? "
2334,2336,Teacher,"Mostly clear except a little bit of clouds. Right. Right, right, right. Yep. Yep. There you go. You got it. "
2345,2347,Teacher,"You sigh like you're in pain, Todd. Is this hurting?"
2354,2356,Teacher,"Come on, you're not gonna make me stand here the whole time, are you?"
2357,2359,New student,No. 
2358,2360,Teacher,"Okay. Then stay on task, okay?"
2359,2361,New student,Where is Kansas City at?
2361,2363,New student,I'm trying to calm her down.
2363,2365,New student,I've got energy because he won't let me talk all day.
2365,2367,Teacher,"Okay. A very good question, Jennifer. That was the other one I hadn't answered. Listen, please. "
2370,2372,Teacher,One of those has a variable direction which means you're not gonna have an arrow shooting into that circle because they're all over the place. 
2378,2380,Teacher,"If you don't have the arrow shooting into the circle, then you can't put the what? Five miles per hour?"
2382,2384,New student,Yeah.
2383,2385,Teacher,"Okay. So put the line on there anywhere. Because if it's variable, it's changing a whole lot. "
2388,2390,Teacher,"So just put it anywhere, and then put the five-mile-an-hour line on there. There's another one, though, that says variable-"
2396,2398,Teacher,Speed.
2397,2399,Teacher,"speed, so put the arrow for the wind direction and then put a V at the end of it, okay? "
2404,2406,Teacher,Because you can't say. It's probably anywhere from three to 15 miles an hour. 
2410,2412,Teacher,Okay? Get it?
2412,2414,New student,Yeah.
2413,2415,Teacher,Okay. Does that help? Okay.
2424,2426,New student,"Okay, with that line stuff with the- with the-"
2431,2433,New student,The calm wind chill?
2432,2434,New student,Yeah. The wind speed.
2433,2435,Teacher,Uh-huh.
2434,2436,Single student,The lines with the five and the 10. How are we supposed to know-
2438,2440,Teacher,Nine is closer to what? Nine or- I mean 10 or five?
2442,2444,Single student,It would be ten.
2443,2445,Teacher,Okay. So use the 10.
2445,2447,Single student,Okay.
2446,2448,Teacher,Okay? And even when you get to the 12- that's halfway between the 10 and the 15- you'll pick.
2453,2455,Single student,Okay.
2454,2456,Teacher,Okay? You can either pick one 10 mile an hour or the 10 mile and five mile.
2458,2460,New student,"What about the ""calm?"" What do you do? Do you just- "
2460,2462,Teacher,Calm you don't put any //line at all.
2461,2463,Single student,//Okay.
2462,2464,Teacher,"There's no line because there's no direction, there's no nothing, okay?"
2465,2467,New student,"Oh. Uh, and another thing. What if you have like three? Do you put like different-"
2471,2473,Teacher,You shouldn't have two on there. It's one or the other. What is that? New York?
2475,2477,Single student,"Yes, New York."
2476,2478,Teacher,Nine-mile-an-hour wind out of the northeast. Which direction is the northeast?
2482,2484,Single student,Up here.
2483,2485,Teacher,"Yeah. So erase that one you've got on the bottom, and then don't forget to put your 10-mile-an-hour line on there. "
2491,2493,Teacher,Okay. 
2498,2500,Teacher,All right. How many of you guys got done here? We only have like 15 minutes. How many have you got gone?
2507,2509,New student,I'm on my first one.
2508,2510,Teacher,On your what?
2509,2511,Single student,My first one.
2510,2512,Teacher,Hannah! Oh. You found all your cities first?
2513,2515,Single student,Yeah. 
2516,2518,New student,I'm like halfway done. 
2520,2522,Teacher,You're halfway done? 
2521,2523,Single student,Yep. 
2522,2524,New student,"What would- mostly cloudy is that, right?"
2524,2526,Teacher,Uh-huh.
2525,2527,Single student,And partly- partly cloudy is half?
2528,2530,Teacher,Uh-huh.
2530,2532,Single student,"And then ""mostly"" is just like 75%?"
2532,2534,Teacher,//Uh-huh.
2533,2535,Single student,//What would the 25% be?
2534,2536,Teacher,What do you think? What is it mostly of if only a quarter of it is dark? 
2538,2540,Single student,Mostly clear.
2539,2541,Teacher,Mostly clear or mostly sunny.
2541,2543,New student,It goes like that.
2542,2544,Teacher,You don't have any on there. 
2543,2545,New student,Oh. 
2544,2546,Teacher,Unfortunately it was a cloudy day all the way around the country.
2548,2550,New student,Like light green air is light rain?
2551,2553,Teacher,Yeah.
2552,2554,Single student,Okay.
2553,2555,Teacher,"Yeah. If you use the- when you use the colored pencils, if they're dull, just use the hand sharpeners please. Don't use the power sharpeners,"
2562,2564,Teacher,"because they chew it up, eat them away. "
2564,2566,New student,That's just (inaudible).
2566,2568,Teacher,Yeah. 
2568,2570,Teacher,"Yeah they drew their hand today, in art. They didn't-"
2574,2576,New student,We had to draw it upside down. 
2575,2577,Teacher,You had to do your hand. Remember you had to do your hand?
2579,2581,Single student,"Yeah, but we had to draw upside down."
2580,2582,Teacher,They haven't got there yet.
2583,2585,Single student,Can I go back there?
2584,2586,Teacher,Don't push too hard.
2585,2587,New student,"Oh, man, it hurts."
2586,2588,Teacher,What are you in now?
2588,2590,New student,I'm in... a reading thing.
2592,2594,Teacher,"Oh, (inaudible). No, you can't come back to art. Sorry."
2603,2605,New student,Creepy.
2606,2608,New student,It's creepy.
2607,2609,Teacher,What's creepy?
2608,2610,New student,My cousin-
2611,2613,Teacher,What?
2612,2614,New student,Her cousin has a crush on him.
2614,2616,New student,No. She used to.
2615,2617,Teacher,Whose cousin?
2617,2619,Single student,My cousin used to.
2618,2620,Teacher,Your cousin has a- had a //crush on you?
2619,2621,Single student,"//She used to. Yeah, that's why she creeps me out."
2622,2624,Teacher,"Oh. Not Lydia, your cousin?"
2624,2626,Single student,Yes.
2626,2628,Teacher,Oh.
2627,2629,Single student,I'm afraid of her.
2628,2630,New student,Oh. 
2628,2630,New student,She's strong.
2629,2631,New student,She really scares me. 
2630,2632,New student,I don't like my cousin; I like my cousin's friends. 
2635,2637,Single student,My cousin scares me. I don't like him. I like my cousin's friends.
2639,2641,New student,I don't know.
2641,2643,Teacher,Make sure you're putting those in the right place.
2643,2645,Single student,I am.
2644,2646,Teacher,Okay. Because it looks like Los Angeles is on top of your circle. Your circle needs to be to the left of that city name.
2657,2659,New student,Five miles an hour variable directions. //Does that need to be in any direction?
2658,2660,New student,"//What one are we on, Los Angeles?"
2661,2663,Teacher,Yes. And that's the one where I told you to just put the arrow anywhere.
2667,2669,New student,"I can't find it, Mitch."
2670,2672,New student,How do you do a variable wind?
2674,2676,New student,"Okay. My parents were in Las Vegas, you know, September 11."
2676,2678,New student,It's there.
2677,2679,Teacher,They were? 
2678,2680,New student,Yeah.
2679,2681,Teacher,Ooh.
2680,2682,New student,"Yeah. You see, they made a really wise decision. You see, originally my dad didn't want to."
2684,2686,New student,"It's the speed, the variable speed."
2687,2689,New student,It's what she said.
2691,2693,New student,And then you put a V on it.
2696,2698,New student,"That's for the five miles per hour, I think."
2700,2702,Teacher,They did drive? I wouldn't have gotten on an airplane.
2702,2704,Single student,They had to drive- they couldn't get- like-
2704,2706,Teacher,Oh. //Yeah.
2705,2707,Single student,//It was either drive or spend 200 dollars a night //to stay at the hotel.
2707,2709,New student,"//I'm sorry, Jeff."
2708,2710,Teacher,Were they even flying planes at that point?
2709,2711,New student,Yeah.
2710,2712,Teacher,When they were coming //back they were?
2711,2713,New student,"//Oh. No. No, they weren't."
2713,2715,Teacher,We weren't having any planes in the air at that point. Wow.
2715,2717,Single student,So they had to drive back and-
2717,2719,Teacher,"It would be a nice drive, unless you're in a hurry."
2720,2722,Single student,"They- they tried to do that. See, they put-"
2723,2725,New student,What's today? The 28th?
2724,2726,New student,"But, I mean, they didn't have that thing- I mean they weren't back- they //initially were supposed to be gone one week. "
2729,2731,Single student,But they weren't back home (inaudible).
2731,2733,Teacher,Oh. Yeah.
2732,2734,Single student,(inaudible) if they didn't have that car.
2734,2736,Teacher,Yeah.
2735,2737,Single student,Because there was so many people //who were just diving to get in a car.
2736,2738,Single student,//Your name's right there.
2738,2740,Teacher,"Oh, I'm sure. Yeah. Supply and demand."
2740,2742,Single student,"They just, like-"
2742,2744,New student,"I drew variable direction. Like, what do you put for variable direction?"
2745,2747,Teacher,Variable direction? I think I answered that a few minutes ago.
2748,2750,New student,I thought you answered variable speed.
2749,2751,Teacher,"What did I say about variable direction, Wes?"
2752,2754,New student,Pardon?
2753,2755,Teacher,What did I say when the direction is variable?
2755,2757,Single student,It can go any- you can just point the arrow in whatever way you want it to.
2759,2761,Teacher,Just put a line on there somewhere to attach your five miles per hour. 
2766,2768,Teacher,There you go. There you go.
2773,2775,New student,Do we have to use different colors?
2775,2777,Teacher,"No. Uh-uh. No. Not on the station model. The whole thing can be the same color. When you shade, if you want to use color, you can use color. "
2783,2785,Teacher,Okay. It's just like shading when you did the station model worksheet.
2787,2789,Teacher,How are you doing over here? 
2788,2790,New student,Good.
2789,2791,Teacher,You get it?
2790,2792,New student,Yeah.
2791,2793,Teacher,Good. 
2793,2795,Teacher,"How many you got done, Mitch?"
2794,2796,New student,"This thing is too big, but-"
2796,2798,Teacher,How many station models?
2797,2799,New student,"One, two, three, //four, five, six, seven."
2798,2800,New student,//Seven.
2800,2802,New student,Eight.
2801,2803,Teacher,"Eight? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Okay. "
2807,2809,Teacher,Yes? Who's calling me? What?
2809,2811,New student,"Since Cape Hatteras is out in the ocean, where are we supposed to put it?"
2811,2813,Teacher,It isn't in the ocean.
2813,2815,New student,There's no dot.
2814,2816,Teacher,It is right- it's a cape so I'm assuming it's like right here. We'll just make it right there. There's the city. Now go with it. 
2824,2826,Teacher,It's not in the ocean.
2826,2828,New student,That's how they showed it on the map. 
2829,2831,Teacher,"Actually, I should show you the picture of the lighthouse that's there. "
2832,2834,Teacher,I'll pull that stuff out for tomorrow because it's kind of interesting.
2847,2849,New student,Where is Cape Hatteras?
2849,2851,New student,It's out in the ocean.
2850,2852,New student,I know but-
2851,2853,New student,It's in the middle of the ocean.
2854,2856,New student,It's the little dot. It's right there.
2857,2859,Teacher,"It's not in your book map. Oh. Yes, it is in your book map. It's not on the plastic map. It's right here."
2861,2863,New student,I know.
2862,2864,Teacher,It's- 
2863,2865,Single student,"I know, but it's-"
2864,2866,Teacher,You know? Why are you asking //me?
2865,2867,Single student,"//Well, it's like ""where do I put it?"""
2866,2868,Teacher,Okay.
2867,2869,Single student,I know because I had to go there.
2868,2870,Teacher,It- it should be like right here somewhere. Anywhere that it looks like it might- right in that little cove area there. 
2876,2878,Single student,There it is.
2877,2879,Teacher,"There- okay. I'll- to put it to you this way, there's a lighthouse on Cape Hatteras so it can't be back in that cove area, right? "
2885,2887,Teacher,It's got to be the most sticking out point of North Carolina. How's that?
2891,2893,New student,That's good.
2892,2894,Teacher,"Okay. But they had to move the lighthouse because the most sticking out point of North Carolina got washed away, and they thought //that they-"
2900,2902,New student,//So the original Cape Hatteras is in the ocean.
2905,2907,New student,"So wait, a continent got washed out to sea?"
2907,2909,Teacher,"Okay, Dorothy. You got me there. "
2909,2911,Single student,I'm confused.
2910,2912,Teacher,I can't- no. They actually rolled it back. It's very interesting.
2913,2915,Single student,//What?
2914,2916,Teacher,"//I'll find the stuff. You keep working, I'll find the picture. "
2916,2918,Single student,That confuses me.
2917,2919,Teacher,You just keep working. Just- 
2918,2920,New student,It's right here. That little part-
2920,2922,Teacher,It's that little part sticking out right there. 
2924,2926,Teacher,"Yeah, everything filled in. You're gonna have to wait for your group mates to figure out their stuff so //that you can move on to it, but-"
2929,2931,Single student,//So Rhode Island is floating up the sea?
2931,2933,New student,No. Rhode Island //is not an island- 
2933,2935,Teacher,"//Look at- look at where your cloudiness is; look at where your precipitation is and you can go ahead and shade that, "
2941,2943,Teacher,and then they're all gonna want to look at yours when they get done so they can copy it.
2944,2946,New student,Rhode Island is not an island.
2947,2949,Teacher,"Rhode Island is not an island, nope. They probably thought it was when they named it."
2962,2964,New student,Where is it anyways?
2963,2965,New student,Where is Rhode Island? 
2965,2967,New student,There is Iowa. 
2972,2974,New student,Rhode Island is-
2977,2979,New student,(If you see) Massachusetts (you see towards) Rhode Island- 
2980,2982,Teacher,"I'm really thinking we need an American geography class, you guys."
2984,2986,New student,"Oh, yeah."
2985,2987,Teacher,Yeah.
2988,2990,New student,Stop.
2989,2991,New student,"Oh, yeah. I see it now."
2990,2992,New student,When did you say it's Rhode Island?
2993,2995,New student,Let's (inaudible) Massachusetts.
2995,2997,New student,Isn't that the tiniest state?
3003,3005,New student,You got issues.
3019,3021,Teacher,"Uh, is there a problem? Do I need to be babysitting?"
3022,3024,New student,No.
3023,3025,New student,Yeah. You need to baby-sit them.
3024,3026,New student,Baby-sit them.
3025,3027,Teacher,"No, I don't think that's in my job description. "
3029,3031,Single student,Baby-sit (inaudible).
3032,3034,Teacher,Not when the kid being babysitted is 14 years old.
3039,3041,New student,That means it's not me because I'm not 14 years old.
3041,3043,New student,Neither am I.
3043,3045,New student,You baby-sit at 14?
3049,3051,Teacher,There it is.
3050,3052,New student,Miss Anderson?
3051,3053,Teacher,Uh-huh?
3052,3054,Single student,Is the higher the humidity where a high pressure is or low pressure?
3058,3060,Teacher,Hmm. Good question. Where would the most humidity be?
3062,3064,Teacher,"Think about- look at- well, think about a weather map. "
3070,3072,Teacher,Where is the precipitation around the fronts? 
3078,3080,Teacher,Precipitation is behind the front or in front of the front?
3080,3082,Single student,It's in front of it.
3082,3084,Teacher,"In front of the front. Okay. So if you're looking at precipitation, you're looking at humidity, too. "
3088,3090,Teacher,So what is higher humidity gonna tell you?
3095,3097,Single student,Precipitation.
3097,3099,Teacher,It's gonna tell you there's precipitation so where would it be located in relationship to the front?
3102,3104,Single student,By the precipitation.
3104,3106,Teacher,What will be by the precipitation?
3106,3108,Single student,The front.
3108,3110,Teacher,The front. What front?
3112,3114,Single student,Cold front.
3113,3115,Teacher,Very good.
3114,3116,New student,Where is Des Moines?
3116,3118,Teacher,It's not Des Moines. It is Des Moines.
3119,3121,Single student,Where is it?
3120,3122,Teacher,It's in Iowa.
3123,3125,New student,I read that book in art.
3125,3127,Teacher,Hmm?
3126,3128,Single student,I was looking through that book in art.
3127,3129,Teacher,Were you?
3128,3130,Single student,One of the last days.
3130,3132,New student,Is the bell going to ring late today?
3131,3133,Teacher,"You know what? I'm not sure. Jennifer, go ask Mrs. O'Brian if she is going to let everybody out for lunch by the bell or at nine minutes after."
3144,3146,New student,Okay.
3145,3147,Teacher,Okay? Okay. So far Jennifer is the only one that got all of the cities plotted.
3150,3152,New student,I'm almost done.
3151,3153,Two or more students,I'm almost done.
3152,3154,New student,Two more.
3153,3155,Teacher,Two more? You might finish if you don't talk.
3157,3159,New student,This is a- 
3158,3160,New student,I haven't been talking all day. 
3159,3161,New student,Yes you have.
3160,3162,New student,I get a lot of //energy when I-
3161,3163,New student,//(inaudible) I hate it.
3162,3164,Teacher,//Sit on your butt.
3163,3165,New student,I don't like this. I get a lot of energy when I don't talk. 
3166,3168,Teacher,You what?
3167,3169,Single student,I don't like this. I get a lot of energy when I don't talk.
3169,3171,Teacher,Tomorrow is gonna be even worse because you won't be allowed to talk in here either.
3172,3174,Single student,I'll be running around the whole- the whole lunch hour.
3176,3178,Teacher,"Mark, sit. Thank you. Work."
3179,3181,New student,We need the map.
3185,3187,New student,I got all the cities.
3186,3188,Teacher,"You got all the cities done? Okay. I told Jennifer to go ahead and- ooh, Cynthia, you went ahead of your group. "
3191,3193,Teacher,You're supposed to be making those decisions with your group together.
3194,3196,New student,Yeah but she- she wouldn't-
3195,3197,Teacher,"Okay. When you get to the point when you are ready to do precipitation and the fronts, decide as a group,"
3203,3205,Teacher,so that you can explain why you think the front needs to go somewhere and then someone else can either debate with you or agree with you. 
3210,3212,Teacher,And don't agree with the person just because they get better grades in science.
3216,3218,Teacher,Because a lot of times when it comes to this kind of stuff they won't get it. It happens an awful lot. 
3223,3225,Teacher,"They know the bookwork, they understand some of the concepts, but when it comes to actually applying them,"
3229,3231,Teacher,sometimes those people that really get good grades have a real hard time with this kind of stuff. Mitch?
3233,3235,New student,Is this homework?
3235,3237,Teacher,No. It is not homework.
3236,3238,New student,"Oh, good."
3238,3240,Teacher,I'm gonna give you one more minute to work and then I'm gonna explain the rest to you. What did she say?
3242,3244,New student,Nine after.
3243,3245,Teacher,Nine after? I figured she was gonna be going to lunch.
3246,3248,New student,So can we get out at the bell?
3248,3250,Teacher,"No. You'll get out before the bell. If you want to get out at the bell, it probably won't ring until a quarter after or so. "
3255,3257,New student,Oh. The bells are behind?
3256,3258,Teacher,The bells are behind. Because it would actually be ringing during the middle of- if we were following that clock during the middle of fourth hour. 
3264,3266,Teacher,It's that middle bell.
3267,3269,Single student,I don't like the fourth- the bell for fourth hour because there's no minute bell which is why I'm always late.
3272,3274,Teacher,You won't be today.
3273,3275,Single student,I know.
3274,3276,Teacher,"Because there will be teachers in the hallway making sure you make it, because you won't be talking to each other in the hallway. "
3278,3280,Teacher,It's actually working out quite nicely.
3280,3282,New student,"I feel like I'm in a state prison. I mean, //don't they-"
3282,3284,Teacher,//That's how we want it to feel.
3283,3285,Single student,About the only difference is that- is that the teachers aren't carrying 12 gauges.
3287,3289,Teacher,"No, we won't do that, but we are definitely- it is definitely a //crackdown situation."
3293,3295,New student,//You just keep hurting yourself.
3294,3296,New student,"Yes, I do, and it's not fair."
3296,3298,Teacher,Work.
3297,3299,Single student,I keep //(inaudible)-
3298,3300,Teacher,//Work.
3300,3302,New student,I have a question.
3301,3303,Teacher,Hm?
3302,3304,New student,How did this ever start anyways?
3303,3305,Teacher,Huh?
3304,3306,Single student,How did that start anyways?
3305,3307,Teacher,Last Friday's behavior.
3307,3309,Single student,(Mine)?
3308,3310,Teacher,No.
3311,3313,New student,Houston's in Texas.
3312,3314,Teacher,Who's done?
3314,3316,Teacher,"Oh, there's that lunch bell. Stop. Freeze. You are responsible to bring the map and the instructions back to this room-"
3323,3325,Other,Can you send Dorothy to the office?
3325,3327,Teacher,She is on her way.
3326,3328,Other,Thanks.
3327,3329,Teacher,"Tomorrow if you don't have it, am I going to give you another one?"
3330,3332,Two or more students,No.
3331,3333,Teacher,No. Are you going to get a grade?
3333,3335,Two or more students,No.
3334,3336,Teacher,No. Just so long as we understand that. Have a nice lunch.
3337,3339,New student,"You, too, Mrs. Anderson."
3339,3341,Teacher,"Make sure everything else is on the middle of the table. Don't- thank you, Jeff."
3342,3344,New student,Do you want your pencil back?
3343,3345,Teacher,"Yes, I want my pencil back. Put that on and leave it on. It's not working, Victoria."
3352,3354,New student,"See you tomorrow, Mrs. Anderson."
