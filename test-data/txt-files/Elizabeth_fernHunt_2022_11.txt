Elizabeth:	00:00:00	I did get sneaky.
Christine:	00:00:02	The marker is on. We are recording. All's well.
Elizabeth:	00:00:07	Somebody make a really loud noise to synchronize.
Christine:	00:00:09	There's only one camera this time. And the funniest thing is that the quiet one actually worked. It synced all the cameras. So as we were watching the footage of the other groups, we heard the loudest beep ever. And we're like, "Oh the quiet one works." It's quite fun. But no, no loud beep today.
Brette:	00:00:32	But yeah. Lizi is going to take notes.
Elizabeth:	00:00:34	Okay.
Brette:	00:00:38	Although Jess and Christine and I were going to watch y'all... The students talking.
Jessica:	00:00:43	So I could potentially talk to you about if-
Elizabeth:	00:00:50	Okay.
Jessica:	00:00:51	... the opportunity presents.
Clarifying student groups - Police academy vs STEM students
Brette:	00:00:52	We have the blue group with-
Christine:	00:00:55	J and S and Z [student names redacted].
Brette:	00:00:58	And then the blue group up here with V[student name redacted]  and-
Christine:	00:01:01	And then J[student names redacted].
Brette:	00:01:02	And A[student names redacted].
Christine:	00:01:02	And someone-
Brette:	00:01:15	And someone else. And then the pink group. We don't have, who was it that?
Christine:	00:01:19	J[student name redacted].
Brette:	00:01:20	J[student name redacted], who's not from, was from us. And then... Starts with a P, I think?
Christine:	00:01:30	P[student name redacted].
Brette:	00:01:32	P[student name redacted]. Thank you. And T[student name redacted], and-
Elizabeth:	00:01:36	Who's wearing the brown sweatshirt?
Brette:	00:01:41	I can't remember.
Christine:	00:01:42	If we're going to see any video.
Elizabeth:	00:01:44	It'll be immediate.
Brette:	00:01:45	It'll be... But anyway, we got this, like we've got these three groups tapes. Um, yeah. This is where you are.
Elizabeth:	00:01:52	Cool.
Brette:	00:01:55	And our goal here is to just help you think about your teaching and to investigate your questions. And so you asked us initially about how the Police Academy students and the STEM students were interacting with each other. And the only two groups. Oh, we thought that P[student name redacted] was in the Police Academy because it looked like she was wearing a uniform.
Elizabeth:	00:02:26	That's an NJROTC uniform.
Brette:	00:02:29	Oh. And so the ROTC is separate from?
Elizabeth:	00:02:31	It is.
Christine:	00:02:32	But did they go on the field trip as well?
Elizabeth:	00:02:36	They must not have because-
Christine:	00:02:37	Because she was talking about the field trip, so we were really confused.
Jessica:	00:02:41	They actually was answering questions about the field trip in the video.
Elizabeth:	00:02:45	Okay. So she was there the day before though. No, maybe not. Maybe not-
Christine:	00:02:54	Wonky.
Elizabeth:	00:02:55	But my NJROTC students were missing from period one, that same day. The day before.
Brette:	00:03:02	Maybe they had a separate field trip?
Elizabeth:	00:03:02	It could have been.
Christine:	00:03:03	Seems like a lot of field trips.
Elizabeth:	00:03:05	Seems like a lot of field trips.
Brette:	00:03:09	Yeah.
Elizabeth:	00:03:09	I might inform my planning for the teacher.
Christine:	00:03:13	And can you be ROTC in any of the STEM-
Elizabeth:	00:03:16	Yes.
Christine:	00:03:16	... arts or? Okay.
Elizabeth:	00:03:17	So the ROTC program is separate from the Magnets.
Brette:	00:03:22	Okay.
Christine:	00:03:23	Oh, wow. Okay. So that's a fourth layer? Yeah. Got it. Cool.
Brette:	00:03:26	Neat.
Elizabeth:	00:03:29	Neat.
Brette:	00:03:31	Okay. So then we have one group that really had some readlly had a mix of STEM and Police Academy students.
Christine:	00:03:40	And the issue is though... The pink... This is going to show-
Elizabeth:	00:03:43	P[student name redacted].
Christine:	00:03:46	P[student name redacted], yes. And we thought that she was a Police Academy student, but the green will show.
Elizabeth:	00:03:53	Eventually.
Christine:	00:03:55	We all know how to do that.
Discussing the green group
Brette:	00:03:57	So here's the green group and this is what the 360 camera shows. It's one bubble and then the other bubble, on the two sides.
Elizabeth:	00:04:06	This is K[student name redacted].
Christine:	00:04:08	Which one? Who's K[student name redacted]? And K[student name redacted] is a STEM student? Okay.
Elizabeth:	00:04:14	The best I could get was then one Police Academy student at a group, because those four that just happened to be the four Police Academy students who turned their paper in, were on that second field trip.
Christine:	00:04:26	Were on that second field trip. Yup yup yup yup yup.
Elizabeth:	00:04:27	Let's ask a different question. I'm sure there's a question we can answer.
Christine:	00:04:33	This is still relevant to that question though.
Elizabeth:	00:04:36	Cool. All right.
Brette:	00:04:36	So there was... oh here is where we can scroll....like 14 minutes for a lot of the class... You should be explaining this part, because you watched the kids so I know what happened.
Christine:	00:04:58	Yeah yeah yeah. So for a lot of the class, there's some really beautiful sense making, happening between these two students. Oftentimes it is this student asking... Black mask.
Elizabeth:	00:05:08	This is A[student name redacted] and A[student name redacted].
Christine:	00:05:10	Perfect A[student name redacted] and A[student name redacted]... Asking A[student name redacted], what's going on? Why is this happening? I'm not quite sure. And most of the time they have a really incredible mathematical conversation. On more than one occasion, A[student name redacted] attempts to engage the other two students at the group. And it's to no avail, at least verbally. There are times where V[student name redacted] will-
Elizabeth:	00:05:35	V[student name redacted].
Christine:	00:05:36	V[student name redacted] will shake her head and she's always always always writing. Always.
Elizabeth:	00:05:42	Writing?
Christine:	00:05:43	Always writing.
Elizabeth:	00:05:43	Okay.
Christine:	00:05:46	Like she's always...To me what seems very engaged in the task, but not engaging in mathematical discourse. And I did not hear K[student name redacted] speak really, at all. So there are two students who are deeply engaged in what's going on, and then two students who are potentially engaged but not in a verbal way. And so this is an example of A[student name redacted] attempting to engage the other students and you'll kind of see him move his book, and look at his fellow colleagues and there's not really a response. And then after this one he kinda gives up trying to... Which I totally understand, trying to engage them verbally.
Recorded Video:	00:06:27	I'm having multiple parts that we're just going to use together at the same time. So this is leading us into 11 dot four. What do you think would happen if I wanted to put five plus i, on this graph? Where do you think it would go? It's not something we've ever done before. We put real numbers on the real axis. We just put imaginary numbers on the imaginary axis.
	00:07:04	(students talking) I don't know.
	00:07:04	Do you think I could put five plus i? Take a minute and share an idea in your group.
	00:07:08	(students talking) Maybe it's like that coordinate thing works, five plus i, you would move five in this direction. And then with one i, here. [inaudible 00:07:27] So we'll move five along the real axis and then one i, along the imaginary axis. So that you have the five plus i. [inaudible 00:07:42].
Christine:	00:07:32	Yeah and that's the end of it.
Brette:	00:07:32	So if you ask what do y'all think? And A[student name redacted] is the only one who ever seems to respond here.
Elizabeth:	00:07:32	Yeah.
Brette:	00:08:05	But V[student name redacted] is... You can see that she's right when she's looking at what-
Christine:	00:08:10	Her eyes are on the book.
Brette:	00:08:12	She's with it. She just doesn't ever say much.
Christine:	00:08:18	Which isn't-
Elizabeth:	00:08:18	It's really interesting.
Christine:	00:08:20	She could be and she does nod her head. There are non-verbal like, "Yep, I'm with you." I just thought it was an interesting thing and I thought the prompt was just so powerful coming from a scholar being like, "So what are y'all's ideas?" I wanted to hear more. And then the second someone said, "I don't really particularly have anything else." It was just like, "Okay." Yep. Right.
Elizabeth:	00:08:41	The day before when half the class was gone, V[student name redacted] and K[student name redacted] were sitting together, and I think it may have been the first time I've heard K[student name redacted] speak out loud about math, and I don't remember specifically what it was. But we had introduced this idea about imaginary numbers and she actually, she asked something... And he answered.
Christine:	00:09:02	Oh.
Elizabeth:	00:09:03	Yeah.
Christine:	00:09:04	After watching this tape that would be really cool to see.
Elizabeth:	00:09:09	But A[student name redacted] is such a strong presence.
Brette:	00:09:16	But trying at least bringing them up.
Elizabeth:	00:09:18	For sure.
Christine:	00:09:21	And the whole warmup too. There were multiple... I just felt this was the most powerful instance of it. And this was the last instance. I think he finally was like, "Yep, I've tried four or five times." Cool cool cool. I don't know if there were any other thoughts on that. It seems you said that's kind of that K[student name redacted] tends to stay quiet. Okay. Do they both and they both tend to stay quiet?
Elizabeth:	00:09:50	Yes.
Christine:	00:09:50	Okay.
Elizabeth:	00:09:53	Yes.
Christine:	00:09:54	Cool.
Elizabeth:	00:09:55	And even V[student name redacted], I might think that if she was with other Police Academy students, she would talk more. But she doesn't really engage with that more.
Christine:	00:10:06	She doesn't talk in either setting? Gotcha.
Elizabeth:	00:10:13	I read somewhere that they, I forget... Some study of newlyweds, and you could predict how the marriage was going to last or not last, by like... Well somebody said something, if they would actually get something back, and even it was-
Christine:	00:10:34	Progressive processing.
Elizabeth:	00:10:36	Or like, "Oh, really?" It doesn't-
Brette:	00:10:38	Fits for connection.
Elizabeth:	00:10:40	Right. So I wonder what, I wonder if there's a strategy... Can I help my students recognize if it's for attention? And at least-
Christine:	00:10:57	I mean even phrasing it that way I think could be really, really powerful. And like that helps in like all aspects of their life. Big time, them just as human beings, not even just only in the math classroom.
Brette:	00:11:10	And I also, like sometimes we'll hear students using sentence stems, not in this class, but just in general. We hear students use sentence stems as a corny way to be like, "So Elizabeth. What do you think?" And then they see it as amusing.
Christine:	00:11:30	Right.
Brette:	00:11:33	But then it actually works. They use it in a corny, jokey way, but then it actually has the effect of-
Elizabeth:	00:11:40	Bringing others into the conversation.
Christine:	00:11:41	Yeah, well.
Discussing the pink group
Brette:	00:11:45	I feel the pink group is a nice foil, even though it's not a STEM...
Christine:	00:11:53	Totally agree. And that's something that I definitely think we can look out for next time, when there are four more students that we can look at. If that's still something that you're interested in thinking about?
Elizabeth:	00:12:06	Absolutely.
Brette:	00:12:11	Why is there only 26 minutes on this video? I don't know, but I want to pull it up.
Christine:	00:12:23	In this video?
Brette:	00:12:24	Yeah.
Christine:	00:12:24	One, oh, nine. That is it.
	00:12:24	J[student name redacted] says you're-
Brette:	00:12:24	So here-
Elizabeth:	00:12:24	M[student name redacted].
Brette:	00:12:51	M[student name redacted], he's doing a ton of negotiating and translating work between T[student name redacted], and-
Elizabeth:	00:13:01	P[student name redacted].
Brette:	00:13:01	P[student name redacted]. So that's a super, it's just super interesting that he's doing that throughout a lot of the class. I think because T was having a hard time hearing P[student name redacted], and so like M’s[student name redacted] kind of the glue here.
Elizabeth:	00:13:15	Okay.
Brette:	00:13:15	Holding the group together. And here they're doing some pretty typical-
Recorded Video:	00:14:29	Those two, that would be negative.
	00:14:29	Square be negative. [inaudible 00:13:33]
	00:14:29	Oh, wait. Actually.
	00:14:29	I might even. [inaudible 00:13:43]
	00:14:29	You guys, this is the big one. This activity, that's the big one of the lesson. So take a minute, make sure that you're checking in. Are you comparing ideas? Are you helping? Are you?
	00:14:43	Asking a question.
	00:14:44	Can multiply that then I don't know if that makes sense.
	00:15:00	Yeah, it does. Just breaking it down to be negative. So that would just be here then, right?
	00:15:01	Yeah.
	00:15:05	But what it would be accumulative right? [inaudible 00:15:08]
	00:15:05	I'll just go.
Christine:	00:15:05	Neither
Recorded Video:	00:15:18	Okay, I'm with you here. So here's two i, there's negative four.
	00:15:26	Yes.
	00:15:26	Put that up there. You've got to mark two I, square. Now it's really two iQ. What are you doing? Did you talk to these guys?
	00:15:37	No, not really-
	00:15:37	I know. Okay, so if this is negative one-
	00:15:44	What's negative one?
	00:15:45	i.
	00:15:46	No, i, is the square root of negative one. So where is two i on this graph?
	00:15:49	Two i? Right over here?
	00:15:49	Yeah. Big dot right there. Now we're going to take two i, and square it.
	00:16:02	So it's two times two.
	00:16:02	Okay. Which makes?
	00:16:09	Four.
	00:16:09	And?
	00:16:09	i, times i.
	00:16:09	Which makes?
	00:16:15	i squared?
	00:16:20	Which can be replaced with?
	00:16:21	Negative one. So negative four time i is one.
	00:16:21	Right. Now keep going. Try to simplify this one because those same strategies, you just use this for multiplying two i. [inaudible 00:16:51]
	00:16:50	Did that help?
	00:16:50	I don't know if this is right, but is that two i, Q?
	00:17:20	We're mathematicians, right? We notice and try to describe patterns.
	00:17:24	I squared...negative eight right because i squared is negative one [inaudible 00:17:25], wait, how it a A, i, is... It will be [inaudible 00:17:38].
	00:17:35	I don't, it might be like this, but then if you think about it.
	00:17:35	It's tabulation [Inaudible 00:17:53] We didn't need-
Brette:	00:17:35	So they're like... The three of them. They're working together a lot.
Elizabeth:	00:18:19	That's a hundred times more words than I heard M[student name redacted], before.
Christine:	00:18:23	Oh, interesting.
Jessica:	00:18:25	That's crazy because he was like central to every group discussion that happened the entire time. And not only would initiate a discussion over here, but when that one was done... Did you get that too? It didn't matter who the other person was, every single time. Like, "I know we were talking, but I also just want to check up on you." He was central to every conversation.
Brette:	00:18:51	And he was like really attentive to making sure that T[student name redacted] could hear like what was going on. Was writing stuff down, to help.
Elizabeth:	00:18:59	That's super cool.
Christine:	00:19:01	It was beautiful.
Jessica:	00:19:02	It was so cute.
Christine:	00:19:04	It made my heart just pitter-patter melt.
Brette:	00:19:06	I would not have guessed that you haven't heard much from him. Like that?
Elizabeth:	00:19:14	He does work and his work is amazing, but to share out loud, he doesn't.
Jessica:	00:19:18	I will say also... I wonder if, because I know when I was taking notes on them as a group, mostly during the class, I also felt like I didn't hear a lot of talking.
Christine:	00:19:31	Yep.
Jessica:	00:19:31	But then watching the video. I'm like, "Oh, every time they're doing group work and they are talking." They're just so hard to hear with all of the other sounds. So I also felt that maybe in the classroom that not a lot of discussion was happening. Then watching the video, there's so much more than it seems.
Elizabeth:	00:19:52	That's amazing.
Christine:	00:19:54	And like Jess said, it did not matter who M[student name redacted] talked to first. He made sure to pivot to whoever he wasn't having a conversation with, at the same time. And it was just this beautiful translation of all three talking.
Elizabeth:	00:20:06	That's so cool.
Brette:	00:20:10	And like J[student name redacted], she was... I mean she was out for half the class, so it made sense when you came over to like explain what i, is... That made total sense, but that part also was pretty typical after she came back, but she wasn't really in-
Elizabeth:	00:20:33	She hadn't seen the day before and probably already feeling like... There's patterns in the class I think, that lead to the students recognizing that they had different experiences the year before. And maybe not all, and again, guys are 10th graders, she's an 11th grader. It's true for all the Police Academy students are 11th graders and almost all the Science Magnet students, are 10th graders.
Brette:	00:21:06	And so they probably don't have any... Or do they have other classes together?
Discussing Police & STEM student interactions/relationships
Elizabeth:	00:21:09	No, they wouldn't have any other classes together.
Christine:	00:21:11	That's also interesting too.
Elizabeth:	00:21:12	But the Police Academy students have almost all of their classes together.
Christine:	00:21:16	Together. Right.
Elizabeth:	00:21:17	And these guys probably don't.
Brette:	00:21:20	Is there a sense of different status where like the Police Academy students feel they're not as good at math, as the STEM students?
Elizabeth:	00:21:30	I think that they have that perception and I think if any part of what we're doing here helps me root out things I might be doing, to contribute to that... That would be super valuable, my impression is that they arrived with those different ideas.
Brette:	00:22:02	I mean and that to me seems super common. I mean, when I was in high school, in any mixed grade class, the younger students are seen as smarter. Because we're all doing the same thing, but you're younger, so you must be smarter. That was just faked intent, every multigrade class that I have, and I wouldn't be surprised if that's also a thing.
Elizabeth:	00:22:31	I think just that... True. I think it's just that practice of sharing your thinking in a math class. I don't think that... I mean I know a little bit about who their teacher was, and how that person teaches geometry. I don't think their ideas were... I don't think their thinking was requested. I think their answers were requested.
Christine:	00:22:52	Sure.
Elizabeth:	00:22:54	To think that idea of sharing thinking, is probably something they're still adjusting to. But there isn't a one number answer that they've already arrived at. Because I try not to ask for the one number answers, so they know... Because they have the tools they need to share, to feel they contribute too.
Brette:	00:23:18	That can be really scary and intimidating for kids too. When they're like, "I've been doing this traditional, I get the right answer, I get the one answer, kind of map." And then Miss H[teacher name redacted], you're changing the rules.
Elizabeth:	00:23:33	Right.
Brette:	00:23:35	And it's one thing... The whole class is changing the rules... I guess probably for P[teacher name redacted].
Elizabeth:	00:23:42	Right.
Brette:	00:23:42	She gives them... And none of them are good at rules other than the math team, they don't know how to play. And so she has to retrain all of them and those rules. And then the Police Academy kids are coming in, half the kids that are younger and in the STEM magnet, they know the rules.
Elizabeth:	00:24:02	They're like, "Oh, Miss, you're just Miss K[teacher name redacted]."
Brette:	00:24:04	Yeah. And then the Police Academy students are like-
Elizabeth:	00:24:08	"Oh, Miss. You're nothing like."
Brette:	00:24:09	Yeah. So you're changing the rules and it's only for half a class.
Christine:	00:24:13	Not even that too, right?
Brette:	00:24:22	Even though half the class is older. I don't know what the answer to the solution is, but it sounds like you can just, on paper... That could... They probably don't know how to play your games.
Elizabeth:	00:24:36	So I want to notice anything I can notice here that helps me. Why did I not help them through that?
Brette:	00:24:49	I don't know... I don't think I saw anything where you were actively making things worse. You weren't... I don't know, talking down J[student name redacted].
Elizabeth:	00:25:07	Right.
Brette:	00:25:09	When she didn't know what, i, was. Because she'd missed a day and a half. I don't think you were making things worse, but I think it's hard to know... Or like it's hard to make it better. I think everything was just staying neutral.
Elizabeth:	00:25:28	But hey, we see any easy wins, we're going to notice what we can notice.
Discussing the blue group
Brette:	00:25:31	Absolutely. And the blue group boys, they were working together super well. With J[student name redacted] and-
Elizabeth:	00:25:45	Oh, cool. Z[student name redacted] and S[student name redacted]. Okay.
Brette:	00:25:47	And Z[student name redacted] and S[student name redacted], they were doing a great job of like putting Jasper in his place, when he needed to be. They were all contributing over to the mathematical thinking, and they were working together super well. It was not... Just like listening to the class, I thought that Jasper might be steamrolling everybody else, and that's not what was happening at all.
Elizabeth:	00:26:13	Okay. So I've got to clone, M[student name redacted] and A[student name redacted].
Christine:	00:26:17	Perfect. That is the solution, easy.

Introducing and discussing the IGS - Elizabeth’s perception of movement and technologies
Brette:	00:26:24	But maybe now be a good time to look at the IGS a little bit more.
Elizabeth:	00:26:28	Okay, sure sure.
Brette:	00:26:30	Let's see. So...We could put the board at the top, maybe? We can look at that. Is it taped?
Christine:	00:26:43	Yeah.
Brette:	00:26:43	I think, I feel that's easier to read.
Elizabeth:	00:26:51	Okay.
Brette:	00:26:51	Does that or like...does that make sense for you?
Elizabeth:	00:26:52	Yeah.
Brette:	00:26:52	Okay. And we can play the movement tapes? All right.
Christine:	00:27:55	So like what do you notice and what do you wonder as you're watching yourself in purple dot form? Move across the classroom?
Elizabeth:	00:28:04	I will wonder about... In the classroom, I feel stuck there, and I wonder if it's actually a problem because maybe it's not a problem. Maybe that's just where I have to stand to write on the board. And there's value in capturing that document and posting it for students later. There was a moment when I started at Fern Hunt that that board wasn't there. So it was just whiteboard on three walls. I wonder if there's an opportunity to... Either or both, spend time here. If I'm writing, maybe it has to be here, but maybe if I'm not writing, I'm just gesturing, maybe I can spend more time here so it's not so heavy on one side. If that is... And I wonder if there's whiteboard space, there's a way to utilize the whiteboard space, for something I don't necessarily need to capture in the notes.
Christine:	00:29:23	Something I will say is I have never seen someone use a smart board so incredibly well. It was magic... You use that board exactly how and why it's meant to be used.
Brette:	00:29:40	You could be on CNN on a lecture panel.
Christine:	00:29:45	You're like drag, crop, cut, move... Drag, crop, type. I was like, "Color code, dot." I was like, "Wow." Normally I see folks use those boards really just as a projection. And so I often am like, "Well we're not going to use all its features, maybe we can think about." But the way that you use all the board features to me was just like... It was incredible and I don't, I haven't really seen someone use it that well.
Elizabeth:	00:30:12	Oh, okay. That's interesting to hear. Thank you. Because there was a moment, there was no there was just three walls of whiteboards when I started and then at Thanksgiving my first year there they're... Well we're going to put a... And I'm like, "Really? Can you put it in?" Because I've been trying to decenter my room because I'm trying to play on team P[teacher name redacted] L too. Right? They're like, "Oh, well no, there's only one place for them." And I'm not really quite tall enough to reach. Okay. So I felt there wasn't a choice, but now it's there, and can I use it in a way that's at least going to help students. So, that's very interesting to hear.
Brette:	00:30:54	Is it possible to like project like to screencast from an iPad or something? Onto the Promethean board?
Elizabeth:	00:31:02	It is possible, yes.
Brette:	00:31:06	And still like do all the drawing stuff?
Jessica:	00:31:11	Yeah. The guy... I used a Promethean board and I can't remember... I like found, I guess all the people in this... Trying to remember the name of the app. But I had an app on my computer and the app on my iPad, and so I made my iPad mirror my computer. And so I basically was running the Promethean software from my iPad, so I could do all the Promethean tools or whatever. It was screen... I'm going to look it up and tell you later. And I notice some come with tablets that are literally Promethean tablets linked, but that's something that your school would probably... You wouldn't want them to get. I think it's more expensive than an iPad.
Brette:	00:31:50	But that would be a way, if you wanted a tablet that... You could do all the Promethean stuff, but a tablet's sort of old school.
Elizabeth:	00:31:56	So I could see it here with my tablet and write on this and it's going to project up there.
Christine:	00:32:00	Yes.
Elizabeth:	00:32:01	That sounds like magic.
Jessica:	00:32:04	If I just use... I used like my personal iPad to my school computer. And it worked great because I was having... My classes were so big that I needed to be around all my kids trying to figure out what's going on and engage with all of them. And so like the iPad worked really, really well. I think I even bought an older used iPad, because I had no money for it. So I bought an old generation iPad-
Christine:	00:32:32	Refurbished is great.
Jessica:	00:32:36	I used that-
Christine:	00:32:36	If you don't need.
Jessica:	00:32:36	I used, I didn't even worry about the Apple pencil at that point. As I was using my regular stylist that worked with a tablet. So it was tricky... You had to not put your hand on the thing. But that was also five years ago, so they're better now.
Elizabeth:	00:32:49	I'd be very interested to...
Lizi Metts:	00:32:51	All the students are going to fight over it, when we're done.
Brette:	00:32:59	Yeah. But do you feel... You said that you felt in the class that you were tied to-
Elizabeth:	00:33:01	I do.
Brette:	00:33:01	To the board a lot. Do you feel that even seeing how much you're moving around or in looking at this... Do you feel you're still tied to the board a lot?
Elizabeth:	00:33:12	Well, I still feel a little tied, but I'm hearing some things that maybe... It might be worth it. It might be worth it. And it's not that I'm not getting out. It takes planning. It takes wearing sneakers a lot of the days, to get out there. But that it-
Christine:	00:33:45	And breaks in the content, that it makes sense.
Brette:	00:33:47	I mean because you are getting between each of these groups basically, like at many points.
Christine:	00:34:03	Is this group... Is this class size typical, for the rest? 30? Okay.
Elizabeth:	00:34:12	This is 34 on the roster. My period one is 33, and my period three is 31.
Christine:	00:34:16	Yeah, okay.
Brette:	00:34:19	That's a lot of kids.
Christine:	00:34:20	Yeah it's a lot of kids in one room.
Brette:	00:34:23	We also looked at the times that you seem to be near the...(inaudible) There we go. There you go, near the blue group. And listening in or talking to the pink group and listening in to the green group. And like when you were at the whiteboard talking to the whole class. We can also change the scale on this a little bit. So you can see-
Does teacher positionality impact student response?
Christine:	00:35:04	The stops at the groups. And this black dot's another whole class. And down there.
Elizabeth:	00:35:15	It'd be really interesting to find out if I address the class from a different place. Do they catch that and act on it?
Christine:	00:35:38	Can you say more about that? When you say catch that and act on it... What do you mean?
Elizabeth:	00:35:43	Well I had a little bit of a feeling that I think this was right after I was talking to J[student name redacted].
Christine:	00:35:48	Yeah.
Elizabeth:	00:35:49	Right.
Christine:	00:35:49	This is the big one friends... Like that? Yeah.
Elizabeth:	00:36:02	So do they just... Do they just receive that as noise? Or I need to do something to get their attention. Do they have a processor that's listening for... Do I just shout louder? Do...Is there something about being here that gets people tuned in? Or does it maybe not matter?
Christine:	00:36:34	It's a fascinating question. Does positionality affect the response?
Elizabeth:	00:36:40	Because if I could even... Maybe it would take practice, maybe it would take like training them and me... If I addressed the class from more different places... Would that be effective? Would it be helpful?
Brette:	00:37:06	I feel the blue group was almost always... If you said something like um like to the whole class, the blue group was answering you, just about always.
Christine:	00:37:17	Yeah. And the green group often was too. A[student name redacted] would have a hand or he would give a "Yep." Or a nod. Or if you said something that didn't make sense, A[student name redacted] and A[student name redacted] would immediately be like, "Wait, okay, so she said that, and we know that with this." And for this group, especially the conversation that all numbers can be complex numbers. And they got to a point that they were like, "Right, so like that like, all right, let's rethink about that." And that discussion was prompted by a question from the blue group that you decided to address to the whole group, that the green group then took up and had an incredible-
Elizabeth:	00:38:04	Oh, yeah.
Christine:	00:38:04	... like discussion about.
Elizabeth discusses cool individual student interactions 
Elizabeth:	00:38:07	Did you know that after class on Friday, I think it was Friday. A[student name redacted] came up to me and he said, "I started thinking about what the square root of i, would be." I'm like, "What a cool class."
Christine:	00:38:21	That is so cool.
Elizabeth:	00:38:24	And then he looked at me, "Miss, do you know the square root of, I?" And I'm like, "What did you find?" Because I don't know the square of i, off the top of my head.
Christine:	00:38:29	Right.
Elizabeth:	00:38:31	So he is like, "Well I thought about it if it was a complex," he actually said, "if it was a complex number that you could square to give you i." And he worked out the freaking algebra. Defined the square of one over two, plus one over root, two i.
Christine:	00:38:45	Wow.
Jessica:	00:38:46	I'm so shook.
Christine:	00:38:48	He's incredible.
Elizabeth:	00:38:49	Right.
Christine:	00:38:49	And that's so interesting to me also, because there was a discussion at the green group, of zero minus two i, versus two minus zero i. And they were trying to grapple with how to make two i, complex, instead of just imaginary. And I feel some of that conversation sparked him going even further into that land. Because the back and forth between him and Azee was incredible.
Elizabeth:	00:39:19	That's so cool. I have to tell you that I am intrigued by complex numbers. It's so much more interesting than any other-
Christine:	00:39:27	Yes.
Elizabeth:	00:39:28	Right. And my period one kids and then kids like A[student name redacted]... They are fired up about complex numbers. I'm like-
Brette:	00:39:36	Well, and we were commenting when we were in the class, we were making notes in the field notes, that, this is so much cooler than what we had.
Elizabeth:	00:39:39	Right.
Christine:	00:39:39	Literally.
Brette:	00:39:39	Don't you see this is so much more fun?
Elizabeth:	00:39:50	Oh, it was probably the next day, it was probably Friday. The every lesson has a... Are you ready for more? Right? Which A[student name redacted] spends his time on and Zach was... It was about Pythagoreans.
Jessica:	00:40:03	Oh, wow.
Motivation for background knowledge of math concepts
Elizabeth:	00:40:03	It's on my period one class. They're like, "Miss, tell me about Pythagoreans." I'm like, "Nobody taught me about Pythagoreans when I was 16 years old."
Brette:	00:40:13	Oh, no.
Elizabeth:	00:40:15	Sorry, I can't answer your question. So today I was like, "Damn, I need more resources on complex numbers."
Brette:	00:40:22	Okay okay. Where did you pull out that? Where did you get that 16th century Italy, business from?
Elizabeth:	00:40:28	Oh, yeah. Okay. So-
Christine:	00:40:30	Because we were wildly impressed about that too.
Elizabeth:	00:40:32	Oh, yeah.
Christine:	00:40:33	Right on the spot.
Elizabeth:	00:40:35	The day that half the class was absent. Right? I had all the science Magnet 10th graders there, and we were zooming through the introduction of i. So, I tried to make it so that all their random weird questions that came up, that sometimes I would have to-
Christine:	00:40:57	Right.
Brette:	00:40:58	Sure.
Elizabeth:	00:40:59	I dug in, because I knew and I didn't want to like... And then when do they get this chance to do this?
Brette:	00:41:05	Sure.
Elizabeth:	00:41:06	So they asked lots and lots of questions, which was amazing. And so I said, my book Chaos, which is great, it's got all those pictures of fractals, but I couldn't find it. I'm like, "What can I do for these kids, because I know they have these questions." So I went to Number File and I found all the complex number videos from Numberphile.
Brette:	00:41:26	Did they file it, P-H-I-L-E?
Elizabeth:	00:41:28	Yeah.
Brette:	00:41:28	Okay.
Elizabeth:	00:41:29	It was a YouTube channel.
Brette:	00:41:30	Oh, okay.
Elizabeth:	00:41:32	And I'm like, "Well, I'm going to grab YouTube video links." And I put them in a place where the kids could find them and I was watching them. And one was... So Cardano... 16th Century Italy. Because we had a [professional development organization name redacted] session once on solving cubics.
	00:41:55	And so this guy was referring to that same time in Italy where they were contest mapping each other. And Cardano comes to this place where he is going to try to solve this cubic, but to do it, he has to multiply one minus the square root of negative 15, with one plus the square root of negative 15. And he is like, "I know it doesn't, I know it's a useless number." Or I think he called it a useless number, but, "I'm going to do it because this is probably what it would look like if I did it, and it gives me 40." Or whatever it is. And that was the answer. And it helped him solve a cubic. And I had just seen that Numberphile video, so that when the kids ask the next day, I was-
Christine:	00:42:34	You were ready.
Brette:	00:42:36	Oh, it's down that YouTube rabbit hole. Amazing. So I guess back to this... What do you notice, I wonder, about this breakdown. I know we don't have the other groups around here, but... What do you notice and wonder about that?
Back to IGS/movement discussion and blue group
Elizabeth:	00:43:02	Well, I didn't feel... I noticed that I didn't hit blue a lot. That was a conscious decision. Because-
Brette:	00:43:10	You didn't what a lot?
Elizabeth:	00:43:11	Hit, blue-
Brette:	00:43:14	Oh.
Elizabeth:	00:43:14	I didn't feel they were going to need me. J[student name redacted]... As long as J[student name redacted] was contained, right? They were going to roast. And I can see, I'm guessing my prediction is that I come down to this aisle first. Because I'm probably here, anyway. Because that's where I... So I can see how that's a natural path. Outside kids get out of the... Yeah so there's some kiddos I definitely don't hit. I hit the groups, but these kiddos around the sides.
Brette:	00:43:56	It's also hard to get behind here. Physically standing along here for a lot of the class and like getting back around here is tricky too.
Elizabeth:	00:44:04	And then the stupid HVAC.
Christine:	00:44:07	Which is literally in the middle. Yeah, no.
Movement and green group
Brette:	00:44:11	One thing that was interesting about the green group is that you like peeked in on them a lot, but you actually didn't say anything, for most of these stops, like it wasn't until-
Christine:	00:44:26	It was about an hour in, that there was a verbal exchange with you and the group. And it started with being like, "Ooh, are y'all super excited to solve this problem?" Like, "Tell me about it?" And then there was a quick... And then I think you were kind of pulled away, and then there was another really great interaction at an hour...an hour and 30 minutes. But until then it was very much so peer and move. And I'm wondering what makes you choose to engage with a group... Specifically like a verbal engagement versus just a monitoring without a conversation?
Elizabeth:	00:45:18	I'm going to guess that I saw them talking and working. Didn't read any puzzles on their faces or puzzles that they were specifically like choosing to engage in something different or challenging. And I for sure, at least on this day, had in my mind that I had mostly Police Academy students, mostly grouped together. Because mostly it was permission forms here, right? And they had, had the whole day before missing.
Christine:	00:45:47	Missing.
Elizabeth:	00:45:47	So I probably had it in my mind like... If they're good, I'm going to swing through. J[student name redacted] was not even there to check in with. So I could get this. I wonder who was sitting here, I don't remember. A[student name redacted] was back here... No, A[student name redacted] was absent.
Christine:	00:46:08	This person had a golden girl's shirt on, which was incredible. And I commented on it.
Elizabeth:	00:46:12	A Golden Girl shirt?
Christine:	00:46:14	Yeah, it was incredible.
Elizabeth:	00:46:15	Really?
Christine:	00:46:16	Yeah, it was incredible. I was like, "Oh, my God, your shirt's incredible." And they were like, "Thank you so much." And I was-
Elizabeth:	00:46:19	Oh, is it S[student name redacted]? Was it boy?
Christine:	00:46:19	Yeah.
Elizabeth:	00:46:20	Oh, it was S[student name redacted]. That sounds about right. Yeah, okay.
Brette:	00:46:26	This is-
Christine:	00:46:26	This is helpful.
Brette:	00:46:30	This is the group.
Elizabeth:	00:46:34	That's her... D[student name redacted]... A[student name redacted], M[student name redacted].
Deep dive into student body language and listening
Christine:	00:46:47	So I heard you say that this specific monitoring pattern was partially informed by... Were folks there the lesson before? Which makes perfect sense. But like you said that you also look at body language and... Do you sense that they're working? And if so... Does it look like they're puzzled or confused? Is there anything else that triggers you to stop, and have a conversation? Or stop and ask a question?
Elizabeth:	00:47:24	Well, a lot of times they'll catch my eye. They'll be... That usually means... To me, that means, "I have a question."
Christine:	00:47:31	They make eye contact?
Elizabeth:	00:47:36	I can see like for these guys, if they're into it, they don't have a reason to disengage from the group to like... Sometimes they get excited and they're like "Miss! (inaudible)". That's-
Christine:	00:47:51	That's the best.
Elizabeth:	00:48:03	So I can see what's in their book. I love this book, there's just stuff for them to do. And it's not like busy work stuff to do. It's like thinking stuff, to do. So it's kind of like a shortcut. If they're into this, and I know that this problem is good and it's taking us down the right thinking path... I'm probably going to let them run with it. Especially in a case where there's going to be plenty other places where I can engage to help people get caught up, or on track.
Brette:	00:48:44	I feel the hard thing about that, and I get this in our class too, is that it's hard for me to remember... If I hear a group talking, it's hard for me to remember which students are talking. And so if I hear, because we have some extraordinarily quiet students, and some extraordinarily vocal students, every class it happens. And sometimes, we have our Js[student name redacted] and we have our Vs[student name redacted]. And it's like hard for me to remember... If I've heard this group talking... Have I heard V[student name redacted] say anything? Because I know I've heard J[student name redacted] say a lot... And how to keep track of that. I mean, because there's too much to keep track of.
Christine:	00:49:27	In addition to the fact that if V[student name redacted] is in... Or a V[student name redacted]-like student is engaged and thinking about it, is you stopping the conversation between the other students... Is that helpful? When is it not helpful? When do you prompt them to chime in and speak, versus not? Lots of decision making points and moments. And like Brette said, this happens in our class all the time. I'm like, "Okay, there's a table of four I'm hearing really great mathematical discourse." And I just keep walking. And then as we reflect, we're like, "Right. But that was two out of four." Or even three out of four, but maybe we should-
Elizabeth:	00:50:13	Yeah. Cool. So you're just going to leave your cameras in my classroom, so that I can-
Christine:	00:50:16	For ever and ever.
Elizabeth:	00:50:17	... record what is happening to see that... To see M[student name redacted] like that? I really had no idea.
Brette:	00:50:24	Great.
Elizabeth:	00:50:24	God. Oh, that makes me so happy.
Brette:	00:50:30	And like...But the way that M[student name redacted] and-
Elizabeth:	00:50:32	P[student name redacted].
Brette:	00:50:34	P[student name redacted], thank you. And he were... They were grooving together, and then J[student name redacted] was just kind of there. And the way that A[student name redacted] and A[student name redacted] were grooving together.
Christine:	00:50:49	Like, really grooving.
Brette:	00:50:52	And V[student name redacted] was listening, and then K[student name redacted] was like, hanging.
Christine:	00:50:58	Yup, agreed.
Brette:	00:51:00	And I don't think, I wouldn't have noticed either of those dynamics until listening or like watching that.
Christine:	00:51:08	Oh yeah. It was when I was physically there and monitoring both the pink and the green group, while I was taking field notes while it was live, I was like, "I got little to nothing." And then when we watched the pink and the green, we were like, "Oh, my God, there's magic, there's magic happening." This is a lot.
Elizabeth:	00:51:30	That's so cool.
Brette:	00:51:37	But helping all the kids feel the magic seems hard. Especially if the Police Academy kids don't know that the magic exists. Right? If they don't know that there is magic to experience.
Christine:	00:51:47	To be had.
Elizabeth:	00:51:53	They'll get there. We'll work on it.
Overall review of class and next steps
Christine:	00:51:56	What time is?
Elizabeth:	00:51:57	I think we're supposed to be done at 3:45. That's my guess.
Brette:	00:52:04	I'm... Darryl told me to have you fill out the survey.
Christine:	00:52:05	Yeah.
Brette:	00:52:06	At the end of this. But is there anything else that you'd like to talk about? Or think about? Or look at?
Elizabeth:	00:52:18	I am very interested to see and hear more video. Either from this one moment, from this one day or from... I mean a have a swivel and like the little markers. So if you have suggestions?
Brette:	00:52:43	There's no reason... I'll share the swivel video, I'll send the links to that with you. If you want to go-
Christine:	00:52:48	Peruse.
Brette:	00:52:48	... peruse any other spots.
Christine:	00:52:54	And when we share that link too, we can also... Well, I would say that there's... There's the group video. We can share the group videos too, right? Or no?
Brette:	00:53:06	We'll share a little folder of videos.
Elizabeth:	00:53:06	Cool.
Christine:	00:53:10	Because there are really, really incredible... I know your other question was sense making and what's happening with the i, and the radical and complex numbers, and imagine what's happening with that. And in all of the groups, there were instances of that. Everything single group had beautiful instances of sense making. And we can even share with you the ones that like from the green group, I can give you like three or four off the top of my head that were like, "Ugh, to watch this and to know this is happening without standing right there and hearing it, is really powerful and incredible." So I just wanted to like note that, I know that was one of your questions. And we started moving around with all this different stuff because that was very clearly happening across your classroom.
Brette:	00:53:52	Oh, yeah.
Christine:	00:53:54	Very clear. It was beautiful.
Brette:	00:53:58	They were doing their thing, it was wonderful.
Elizabeth:	00:54:01	That's awesome. Okay, so I then...the work is to figure out how to make sure I'm bringing the other half of the class with us?
Brette:	00:54:19	And I wouldn't say...I mean that....All of the groups, even the ones with a lot of Police Academy students, they were all talking about that, at one point. So it's not like you're leaving them behind entirely, but your sense of there might be some weird dynamics between the Police Academy students and the STEM students like, that seems accurate.
Christine:	00:54:42	And also your like read on some folks having discourse tools, and some folks maybe not having the same discourse tools, also seems very accurate.
Elizabeth:	00:54:56	All right.
Brette:	00:54:57	Do you want to like brainstorm ways to help build that community? Or do you want to like think on it? I just want to make sure that we're helpful for you.
Christine:	00:55:13	I appreciate that. Appreciate that. I feel I have places to go with P[teacher name redacted] and the Police Academy math teachers, who have already opened up a discussion. The Police Academy, the SPAG scores came back. And last year's 11th graders in the Police Academy... One student, proficient in math.
Brette:	00:55:31	So they want to come play our games? Your games?
Christine:	00:55:36	P’s[teacher name redacted] games, everyone's games, the goal, the pinnacle.
Elizabeth:	00:55:39	It's related to the-
Brette:	00:55:40	That's exciting.
Elizabeth:	00:55:40	It is.
Christine:	00:55:41	That's very exciting.
Elizabeth:	00:55:42	They both, there are two. They've both been observing in my class, this year. And like the Police Academy Magnet Coordinator came up to me there, she's like, "I don't know what you did, but there's a fire lit under L[teacher name redacted]." He's in, and in meetings he's like, "I really think this new curriculum is going to help." And he was like-
Christine:	00:56:08	Woah that's really awesome. That's super cool.
Brette:	00:56:11	That's like the opposite of what y'all have described. Just talking to you and P[teacher name redacted] about who's at your school and stuff, that's not what I have heard. That's really exciting.
Elizabeth:	00:56:22	So that's... L[teaher name redacted] teaches algebra too. It's easy for him to observe because we're doing all the same stuff. And the geometry teacher who these kids all had last year... Right? So there's something going on, there's stuff moving. And I feel like, "I don't know that I'm going to say all of this, but we can all talk together about."
Brette:	00:56:48	Right.
Christine:	00:56:49	Oh, I love that.
Brette:	00:56:50	That's super cool.
Elizabeth:	00:56:52	My gosh. You guys got to come in the second half of the year and see the progress. Is that what the? Yeah? Okay.
Brette:	00:57:01	We would love that.
Christine:	00:57:03	And we also-
Brette:	00:57:03	We would need more consent forms.
Elizabeth:	00:57:06	Yes.
Christine:	00:57:09	And in the meantime, we're always available to chat and to communicate.
Elizabeth:	00:57:13	I love it. Thank you.
Brette:	00:57:15	I'm so glad that we get to meet with you this year.
Christine:	00:57:24	Yeah, it's so wonderful.
Elizabeth:	00:57:24	I wish T[teacher name redacted] could have been here for this conversation.
Brette:	00:57:24	That is true.
Christine:	00:57:24	Probably next time.
Elizabeth:	00:57:26	Yes. Yes. Cool. So the next time you come, you'll tape one of their classes. Right. And then we'll just keep doing this until-
Christine:	00:57:35	Forever and ever and ever.
Elizabeth:	00:57:36	Until math is as amazing as-
Brette:	00:57:38	It can be, here in this whole classroom.
Elizabeth:	00:57:39	All right.
Brette:	00:57:39	Try and just experience magic. That's the goal.
Elizabeth:	00:57:46	There is something about... Complex numbers have never been magic to me. And there is something about the treatment here or the timing or the student, something like... It was magic.
Christine:	00:57:56	I mean, I've never really seen it taught in a super magical way. And that was magic.
Jessica:	00:58:02	Amazing and wonderful.
Christine:	00:58:05	And I walked into Math Disneyland.
Brette:	00:58:09	And I loved that your desks are numbered in a spiral. Just like the spiral you were having them draw?
Elizabeth:	00:58:20	I never thought of that.
Brette:	00:58:24	Wait, you just... What? How did you come up with that?
Elizabeth:	00:58:25	Spiral, but it wasn't because...
Brette:	00:58:30	But it's the same spiral you were drawing.
Christine:	00:58:33	It was.
Elizabeth:	00:58:33	I know but I never...
	00:58:34	I made the groups a year ago, before.
	00:58:38	Thank you.
Brette:	00:58:38	That's like-
Christine:	00:58:38	Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Lizi:	00:58:41	Oh. The app that I used was called Splashtop.
Elizabeth:	00:58:45	Splashtop. Like a pool. In 14 minutes, remind me about Splashtop.
Jessica:	00:58:58	That's so handy.
	00:59:03	That is a-
Brette:	00:59:04	I do that all the time.
Elizabeth:	00:59:05	I pick up my students phone, I'm like, "Tonight remind me that I need my Unit three Workbook. We've been working on unit three for three weeks and I still don't remember." Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Thank yous and goodbyes
Lizi:	00:59:17	Thank you so much.
Elizabeth:	00:59:19	Safe travels.
Jessica:	00:59:20	Thank you.
Lizi:	00:59:21	Thank you.
Elizabeth:	00:59:21	Come back to us soon.
Christine:	00:59:22	Yes.
Elizabeth:	00:59:23	I can't wait.
Brette:	00:59:25	Oh wait, halloween pictures?
Elizabeth:	00:59:27	Oh, yes.
Brette:	00:59:29	I'll trade.
Christine:	00:59:30	Oh yeah. You guys made the Maze didn't you?
Elizabeth:	00:59:36	We did.
	00:59:36	Amazing. I love it. Miss Frizzle.
Brette:	00:59:44	And see we got our markers because we're using this.
Elizabeth:	00:59:48	That's so cool.
Christine:	00:59:52	Yeah, I want to see the maze. What was it made out of?
Brette:	00:59:55	I don't cook. So we order pre-made meals from Freshly. So this is like a hundred Freshly boxes opened up with cardboard screws, which are super awesome. So we set up little scenes and these little alcoves... And then like-
Elizabeth:	01:00:20	Oh, my God.
Brette:	01:00:31	And then that's it, built.
Christine:	01:00:31	Whoa.
	01:00:31	Oh, you really did the thing. Oh my gosh. That's really fun. Oh, my God. I would've loved that as a kid. Are you kidding? Oh, my goodness gracious me.
Brette:	01:00:48	That is so brilliant.
Elizabeth:	01:00:49	M[child’s name redacted] would have loved that, if she was here.
Christine:	01:00:49	Wow.
Brette:	01:00:49	In my head you just have this tiny toddler or something.
Christine:	01:00:50	And now they're a larger tiny human.
Elizabeth:	01:00:53	Wow.
Christine:	01:00:53	Thank you again.
Elizabeth:	01:00:55	Thank you ladies so much.
Collective grou...:	01:00:55	Bye.
