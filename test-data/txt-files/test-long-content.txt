Alice: This is a very long piece of content that goes on and on and on. The purpose is to test how the parser handles extremely long lines of text that might occur in real transcripts when someone speaks for a long time without interruption. This could be a monologue, a lecture, or someone telling a long story. We want to make sure that the parser doesn't truncate or have issues with long strings. This sentence keeps going to add more length. And more. And even more text here. Still going strong with additional words and phrases to really push the limits of what might be considered a reasonable line length in a transcript file.
Bob: Short reply.
Alice: Another extremely long paragraph that tests the boundaries of text parsing. When people speak at length, especially in academic or professional settings, they might have paragraphs that span hundreds of words without natural breaking points. This is completely normal and the system should handle it gracefully. We're adding more text here to ensure we have a substantial test case. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs. How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!
