Professor: Today we'll discuss quantum mechanics, which is
a fascinating subject that deals with the behavior of
matter and energy at the smallest scales.
Student: That sounds complicated. Can you explain
more about how particles behave?
Professor: Of course! At the quantum level, particles exhibit
wave-particle duality, meaning they can behave as both
waves and particles depending on how we observe them.
This is one of the most counterintuitive aspects.
