Professor,Today I want to talk about the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. This is a topic that has fascinated physicists for over a century and continues to challenge our understanding of reality. The key insight is that at the subatomic level particles behave very differently from what we observe in everyday life. They can exist in multiple states simultaneously and their properties are not determined until they are measured.,0,30
Student,So you are saying that before we observe a particle it does not have a definite position? That seems impossible. How can something not be somewhere specific?,30,38
Professor,Excellent question. This is exactly what troubled Einstein. He famously said that God does not play dice with the universe. But experiment after experiment has confirmed that quantum mechanics is correct. The double slit experiment for example shows that individual electrons create an interference pattern as if each electron passes through both slits simultaneously.,38,58
Student,What about quantum entanglement? I read that two particles can be connected across any distance.,58,64
Professor,Yes entanglement is perhaps the strangest aspect of quantum mechanics. When two particles become entangled measuring one instantly affects the other regardless of the distance between them. Einstein called this spooky action at a distance.,64,80
