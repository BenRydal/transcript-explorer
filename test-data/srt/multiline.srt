1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This is the first line of a multi-line cue.
And this is the second line.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,000
Sometimes subtitles break across
multiple lines for readability
and this is line three.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,500
Back to a single line here.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Another multi-line example
with two lines.
