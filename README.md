![repo](./static/images/te-low-res.png)

Welcome to **Transcript Explorer!** Transcript Explorer is an open-source tool to dynamically visualize transcripts of conversation and interaction linked to video. It provides a set of visualization techniques to visually explore transcripts and interact with video over time. Transcript Explorer runs entirely in your browser. No transcripts or videos are uploaded, stored, or transmittedâ€”your data stays on your device at all times.

## Get Started

## Transcript Explorer Features

- **Browser-based**: Everything in your browser.
- **Visualizations**: Create different dynamic visualizations of transcripts.
- **Mix multi-modal data sources**: Explore transcripts and video simultaneously.
- **Interactions and animations**: Create dynamic animations to communicate your data
- **Use in qualitative and quantitative projects**: Supports projects spanning micro-ethnographic scales or larger analyses of conversation in settings like classrooms, museums, and virtual environments.
- **Future features**: We are rapidly developing and expanding features of this tool, and collaborators in this effort are welcome.

## Frameworks and Libraries
